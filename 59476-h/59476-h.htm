<h2 id="Foreword">Foreword.</h2>


<p>The stories in this volume were written simply
because of my interest in the stories themselves
and because of a whimsical fondness for the people
of that Race to whom God has given two supreme
gifts,&mdash;Music and Laughter.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the curious, I may say that
many of the incidents in these tales are true and
many of the characters and places mentioned
actually exist.</p>

<p>The Hen-Scratch saloon derived its name from
the fact that many of its colored habitués played
“craps” on the ground under the chinaberry
trees until the soil was marked by their scratching
finger-nails like a chicken-yard. The name Tickfall
is fictitious, but the locality will be easily
recognized by the true names of the negro settlements,
Dirty-Six, Hell’s-Half-Acre, Shiny, Tin-row,&mdash;lying
in the sand around that rich and
aristocratic little town like pigs around their dam
and drawing their sustenance therefrom.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts’s real name is Perique. Perique
is also the name of Louisiana’s famous homegrown
tobacco, and as Skeeter is too diminutive to
be named after a whole cigar, his white friends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
have always called him Butts. Vinegar Atts is a
well-known colored preacher of north Louisiana,
whose “swing-tail prancin’-albert coat” has been
seen in many pulpits, and whose “stove-pipe,
preachin’ hat” has been the target of many a stone
thrown from a mischievous white boy’s hand.
Hitch Diamond is known at every landing place
on the Mississippi River as “Big Sandy.”</p>

<p>When these tales were first published in the
<i>All Story Weekly</i>, many readers declared that
they were humorous. Nevertheless, I hold that
a story containing dialect must necessarily have
many depressing and melancholy features. But
dialect does not consist of perverted pronunciations
and phonetic orthography. True dialect is a
picture in cold type of the manifold peculiarities
of the mind and temperament. In its form, I have
attempted to give merely a <i>flavor</i> of the negro
dialect; but I have made a sincere attempt to
preserve the essence of dialect by making these
stories contain a true idea of the negro’s shrewd
observations, curious retorts, quaint comments,
humorous philosophy, and his unique point of
view on everything that comes to his attention.</p>

<p>The Folk Tales of Joel Chandler Harris are
imperishable pictures of plantation life in the
South before the Civil War and of the negro slave
who echoed all his master’s prejudice of caste and
pride of family in the old times that are no more.</p>

<p>The negroes of this volume are the sons of the
old slaves. Millions of them live to-day in the
small Southern villages, and as these stories indicate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
many changes of character, mind, and temperament
have taken place in the last half-century
through the modifications of freedom and
education.</p>

<p>This type also is passing. In a brief time, the
negro who lives in these pages will be a memory,
like Uncle Remus. “Ethiopia is stretching out
her hands” after art, science, literature, and
wealth, and when the sable sons of laughter and
song grasp these treasures, all that remains of
the Southern village negro of to-day will be a few
faint sketches in Fiction’s beautiful temple of
dreams.</p>

<h3>I<br />

A BRAND FROM THE BURNING</h3>

<p>Diada was a sight.</p>

<p>She stood on the Gaitskill lawn motionless as a
brown wooden statue, gazing like a homesick child
toward the purple haze which hung over the Little
Moccasin Swamp. Her hips bulged out behind like a
bustle; her stomach protruded in front like the chest-protector
of a fat baseball-catcher; her back curved
above her hips and bent at her shoulders, giving her
the appearance of a hunchback; and as for her face&mdash;well,
the children of Tickfall took one look at that
mug and hiked for home, howling at every step; the
pious took a look and crossed themselves; the ungodly
“cussed”; and it is rumored that some negroes
turned white.</p>

<p>Every feature of that face was a horror.</p>

<p>Her head was covered with a mat of coarse hair
growing down on a sloping forehead almost to her
eyebrows; her eyes were immensely large and protruding,
and had the wolf’s vicious glint and surly shifting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
glance; her nose was no longer adorned, according to
the custom of her native land, by having long thorns
and splinters of bone thrust through it, but it had
suffered grievously from this devotion to fashion,
and was now a battered daub of a snout which looked
as though it had been run through a sausage-grinder
before it was smeared on her face; her ears had been
so deformed by carrying heavy iron rings that the
lobes hung down nearly to her shoulders and flapped
at every motion of her head like the loose-hung
ears of the hound; and her mouth was a cavernous
monstrosity&mdash;great, horrid, horselike teeth protruding
outward, and covered with thick, repulsive lips
which curled back when she spoke or grinned until
the blue gums of the upper teeth were revealed.</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill was among the ungodly
who gazed upon this horrific vision with profane
utterance. He turned to the tall, weather-tanned
man who sat beside him on the porch and spoke:</p>

<p>“Lem, I have known you and loved you for thirty
years. I have applauded most of the things you
have done. But it is now my solemn duty to inform
you that you are a d&mdash;&mdash; fool!”</p>

<p>Captain Lemuel Manse broke into a loud laugh.
He looked at Diada and laughed again; then he looked
at Gaitskill’s horrified countenance and laughed
louder.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you have none of the spirit of the
Christian missionary, Tom,” Manse finally managed
to say.</p>

<p>“If the Christian missionaries in the Pacific
Islands are engaged in saving the immortal souls of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
she-baboons like that,” Gaitskill snorted, pointing
to Diada, “I’ll never give ’em another cent&mdash;not a
dang cent!”</p>

<p>“Diada was made in the image of God, Tom,”
Manse snickered.</p>

<p>“She may have been&mdash;<i>once</i>!” Gaitskill snapped.
“But a hooliboogoo ran over her and mussed up that
image considerably. When are you going home?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?” Captain Manse inquired.</p>

<p>“My eyes are getting sore looking at that heathen
cannibal&mdash;that’s why I ask,” Gaitskill replied.
“When are you going to take her away from here?”</p>

<p>“Tom,” Manse said in a voice of mock sadness
and reproof, “I’m surprised at you. It’s been five
years since I was a guest in your hospitable home,
and in less than two hours after my arrival you
inquire the time of my departure! Shame!”</p>

<p>“Keep your eye on that nigger!” Gaitskill said
with a chuckle as he pointed to a giant black who
came through a side gate into the lawn.</p>

<p>With the free stride of the athlete, Hitch Diamond,
the immense, coal-black prize-fighter, came
across the grass, his eyes following the winding
galleries of the house, apparently in search of Mr.
Gaitskill.</p>

<p>He came face to face with Diada before he noticed
her; he gazed with popping eyeballs; his pugilistic
courage and his giant strength oozed out at his bootheels,
and his iron jaw dropped down and wigwagged
like the loose under lip of a plug horse sleeping in the
sun.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” he exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>He slunk slowly backward until he got some thorny
shrubbery between himself and Diada, and then his
ponderous feet beat a wild tattoo of panicky retreat
upon the sodded turf.</p>

<p>“There, now!” Gaitskill exclaimed. “Hitch Diamond
has given an outward and visible manifestation
of my inward and spiritual emotions. Look at the
wench! She hasn’t moved a muscle of her body for
twenty minutes! Can’t you get her to do something?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Captain Manse answered, feeling in his
pocket and bringing forth a ten-cent piece. “Have
you got a dime in your pocket?”</p>

<p>Gaitskill produced the silver piece and held it out.</p>

<p>“No,” Manse said, “I don’t want to touch it.
Throw your money out there in the grass!”</p>

<p>The two men tossed their coins out into the thick
Bermuda grass, and Manse gave a sharp whistle.</p>

<p>Diada turned and trotted toward him like a dog.</p>

<p>“Hunt, Diada!” Manse exclaimed, pointing to the
grass. “Hunt!”</p>

<p>Diada wheeled and made a wide circle around
that part of the lawn; then traveling in a steady trot,
she made ever narrowing circles, eyes searching the
ground. Suddenly she stopped, picked up a silver
dime, placed it to her nose, gave a snort of disgust,
and tossed the coin aside.</p>

<p>“That was your money,” Manse explained.
“She’ll find mine in a minute.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, Diada pounced upon the silver
piece and came trotting up to the porch and placed
it in her master’s hand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>“Ah, I see!” Gaitskill exclaimed comprehendingly.
“I have spent my life hunting for my collar-buttons,
shirt-studs, hat, and socks. So have you. So has
every man. And you’ve brought this cannibal belle
to this country with you to help you find yours!”</p>

<p>“No, Tom,” Captain Manse laughed. “I bought
Diada to save her life. My yacht stopped at one
of those little islands in the Pacific Ocean which
has about a thousand inhabitants&mdash;there’s no end
of such islands out there. The cannibal chief
came on board with Diada and offered to sell her
to me.”</p>

<p>“He explained that he had captured her from a
neighboring tribe and had intended to eat her. I
bought her for about eleven dollars, paying for her
in red calico, brass beads, and some tinware. The
cannibal chief put one of the tin buckets on his head
for a hat and rowed away as happy as an angel with
a crown upon his forehead and a harp within his
hand.”</p>

<p>Manse broke off and emitted a sharp whistle.
Diada came to him on a trot.</p>

<p>Manse caught her left hand, pushed back the
loose sleeve of her white dress, and bared her arm.</p>

<p>Gaitskill shuddered.</p>

<p>Just below her elbow was the slowly healing scar
of a most horrible wound.</p>

<p>“My stars!” Gaitskill exclaimed. “That wound
looks like it had been made by teeth!”</p>

<p>“That’s where the old chief bit her to see if she
was good to eat,” Manse explained. “He said she
was too tough.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Gaitskill glanced at Diada’s face. The vicious,
surly glint was gone from her eyes, and she gazed
with a mild, pleading look upon the man who had
saved her&mdash;the look of the dumb animal which has
suffered and shows gratitude for relief. Gaitskill
underwent a change of heart. He rose to his feet
and stood facing them both.</p>

<p>“Lem,” he said, “if that cannibal chief had showed
me that wound I would have bought Diada if she
had cost me a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Tom,” Manse replied quietly. “There
was nothing else for me to do.”</p>

<p>Diada turned and walked back to the lawn, taking
the same motionless posture, gazing out toward the
purple haze of the Little Moccasin Swamp.</p>

<p>Gaitskill sat down, lit a cigar, and gave himself up
to deep thought. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Now that you’ve got her, Lem, what are you
going to do with her?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to give her to you!” Lem said quietly.</p>

<p>“Wha-what?” Gaitskill barked, springing to his
feet again. “Good gosh!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to do that, Tom,” Manse said defensively.
“This is the first time she has been on land
since I bought her. Now, I’d like to leave her here
with you all the time, but if you won’t keep her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Gaitskill snapped. “You can bet on
it, I won’t!”</p>

<p>“Well, keep her here for me for two weeks,”
Manse pleaded. “I’ve got to run up to St. Louis on
some business, and when I come back, I’ll take her
away with me.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>“That sounds easy,” Gaitskill remarked. “Do
you think Diada will stay with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I tell her to.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Gaitskill assented. “I’ll keep her.
I’ll turn her over to the care of the niggers and
forget her&mdash;if I can. But I want you to give her all
the instructions necessary for the next two weeks.
I don’t speak cannibal.”</p>


<h3>II<br />

HITCH HAS VAGUE MISGIVINGS</h3>

<p>When Captain Lemuel Manse and his wife had
been whirled away in the Gaitskill automobile to the
Tickfall landing where their yacht awaited them
in the Mississippi River, Gaitskill sat down on the
porch to think over his troubles.</p>

<p>Diada stood before him on the lawn, motionless
and ugly as a heathen idol, her eyes still watching
the purple haze above the swamp.</p>

<p>“Something over in that swamp has got to be
hypnotized,” Gaitskill muttered to himself as he
watched her. “When she gets a little tame I’ll take
her for a trip to the hog-camp. I suppose she never
saw anything but a cocoanut palm.”</p>

<p>He leaned over the porch railing; looked back
toward the rear of the house; cupped his hands around
his mouth like a trumpet, and bellowed:</p>

<p>“Oh, Hitch! Come here! Hear me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, white folks! Comin’! Comin’ wid a
looseness; comin’ right now!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Hitch came, but he chose a very unusual route&mdash;through
the house. Arriving at the door which
admitted him to the porch where Gaitskill sat, he
stopped, peeped at Gaitskill, then peeped at Diada,
and ducked back into the room.</p>

<p>“Come here, Hitch!” Gaitskill commanded.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Marse Tom,” Hitch muttered. “I’s
axin’ you whut you wants?”</p>

<p>“Come out here! What in the name of mud is
the matter with you?” Gaitskill bawled.</p>

<p>Hitch came out, his ponderous feet paddling along
the floor like a lame duck, while his eyes never
strayed from the broad, hunched back of Diada.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, Marse Tom,” Hitch pleaded. “Dat
new she-queen you’s hired to dec’rate dat lawn is
done deprive me of my goat!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Hitch!” Gaitskill snapped,
smothering a desire to laugh. “That nigger woman
is Captain Lemuel Manse’s house-servant. She’ll
be here with us two weeks. I want you and Hopey
to treat her kindly and make her feel at home.”</p>

<p>“Boss, is she gentle?” Hitch asked as if he were
alluding to a newly purchased horse.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Gaitskill assured him. “What’s the
matter with you? Diada is just a nigger woman like
Hopey.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so suh,” Hitch mumbled. “But she
shore don’t look like Hopey in looks.”</p>

<p>“Take her around to the kitchen and give her
something to eat,” Gaitskill commanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Hitch answered obediently, but his
tone expressed the exact denial of his words, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
stood right where he was. “Yes, suh; I’ll fetch her
aroun’ to de kitchen&mdash;er, uh&mdash;atter while&mdash;soon’s I
kin git aroun’ to it. Ole miss tole me to go down to
de sto’house right now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She told you nothing of the sort!” Gaitskill
snapped. “Take Diada to the kitchen. Tell Hopey
I said feed her. Hear me?”</p>

<p>Hitch’s whole body moved in the general direction
of Diada, with the exception of his feet. He swayed
toward her like a pendulum, and then swung back.
He took a big breath, looked at Gaitskill, and
muttered:</p>

<p>“Lawdamussy, Marse Tom, dat woman is <i>wild</i>;
dat’s a plum’ hawg-wild nigger, fer shore! An’, boss,
I tells you honest&mdash;ef any cullud pusson in de worl’
is wilder dan whut I is, I don’t wanter had nothin’
to do wid ’em.”</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” Gaitskill roared. “Come down
here in the yard with me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; I’s right on yo’ hip. I’ll foller as fur
as you leads de way.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill laid his hand upon Diada’s arm, and she
turned and looked at him with a suspicious glance,
like the expression in the eyes of a dog when petted
by a stranger. Hitch backed away.</p>

<p>“Look out, Marse Tom!” Hitch howled. “She’s
gittin’ ready to kick!”</p>

<p>In a moment Diada’s eyes changed to a milder
expression, and Gaitskill patted her on the shoulder
about as he would caress the side of a horse. Seeing
this, Hitch crept up nearer, put out his hand and
touched Diada’s wrist.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>“She feels like a shore-’nuff, nachel-bawn nigger,
Marse Tom,” he exclaimed. “Kin she talk?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Gaitskill told him. “But she can’t talk
our language, Hitch. She hasn’t been in this country
long. You’ll have to make signs to her and talk
to her that way.”</p>

<p>“Ax her to say somepin’, Marse Tom!” Hitch
begged. “Lemme hear how she sounds!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill had not the remotest idea how to make
her talk; in fact, he had never heard the sound of her
voice. But he did not intend to reveal his ignorance
to Hitch Diamond.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “She can talk in the kitchen.
Take her around to Hopey.”</p>

<p>Hitch walked up, crooked his forefinger, hung it
lightly in the sleeve of Diada’s dress, and murmured:</p>

<p>“Come along with me, Sister Diada&mdash;foller along
atter brudder Hitchie Diamond&mdash;us’ll go git some
hot vittles!”</p>

<p>Diada took one step forward; Hitch winced as if
anticipating a kick and stopped.</p>

<p>“Fer de Lawd’s sake, Marse Tom!” he howled.
“I don’t <i>want</i> dis strange cullud pusson walking
behine me! You lead her to de kitchen an’ lemme
fetch up de rearwards!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill laughed, caught Diada by the sleeve, and
led her to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Hopey, the cook, had just taken a pan of hot
biscuit out of the oven when the door opened and
Diada came in, filling the doorway like a picture in a
frame and concealing Mr. Gaitskill, who walked
behind her. Hopey’s biscuit-pan hit the floor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
with a bang, the biscuit rolled around the kitchen,
and Hopey sank down in a heap on the nearest
chair, covering her head with her flour-sprinkled
apron.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lawd,” she said, rocking herself from
side to side and whimpering like a puppy. “De ole
debbil is done come to git me at last!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Hopey!” Gaitskill commanded. “Get
up from there!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Marse Tom!” Hopey whooped. “Is de
Ole Scratch gone?”</p>

<p>“Look up, Hopey, an’ trus’ de Lawd!” Hitch
Diamond boomed, walking over and snatching the
apron off of Hopey’s head. “Marse Tom is done
hired a new fancy cook. He tole me she wus jes’
like you. Take a look, Hopey!”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Hopey raised her head. Then
her wide, easy-smiling mouth widened into a laugh
which shook the rafters of the house.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” she giggled, “you shore is one
smart white man. You been blimblammin’ me fer
twenty year because I feeds eve’y nigger whut pokes
his head in my kitchen do’. You ain’t gotter feed
dem mens no mo’, Marse Tom! Des new cook ain’t
gwine be attracksome to nobody!”</p>

<p>“Hitch is lying to you, Hopey,” Gaitskill laughed,
glad to find that Hopey was not afraid of Diada.
“Diada is here for just a short visit. I want you
and Hitch to take care of her for the next two weeks.
Feed her something right now!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill walked through the house, seized his hat
and hurried down-town. He had enough of Diada
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
and the negroes, and if anything happened he wanted
to be absent.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, Hopey promptly assumed the rôle
of hostess and boss.</p>

<p>“Pick up dem biscuits, Diader!” she commanded,
pointing to the floor. “You made me drap ’em,
now pick ’em up! You got to he’p me eat ’em,
too!”</p>

<p>Diada, getting more information from Hopey’s
gestures than from her speech, stooped down, picked
up a hot biscuit, passed it under her nose, snorted
with intense disgust, and hurled the biscuit from her
with such force that it flattened against the wall and
stuck there.</p>

<p>“Hey, dar! Whut you mean, nigger?” Hopey
whooped. “Stop flinging dat biscuit aroun’ like it
wus a gob of mud!”</p>

<p>Diada glanced around and pounced upon the
only thing in the kitchen with which she was familiar&mdash;a
carving knife with a long steel blade. She thrust
it into the folds of her dress.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on, dar, sister!” Hopey admonished her.
“Marse Tom don’t allow no stealin’ niggers aroun’
him. Fetch out dat butcher-knife! Excusin’ dat,
I gotter slice some ham fer dinner.”</p>

<p>Understanding the gestures, Diada returned the
knife and Hopey proceeded to slice a large ham.
She laid four large cuts upon a plate, then turned
her back for a moment. When she looked again
Diada had devoured every slice and was hacking at
the big ham with the carving knife!</p>

<p>“Whoop-ee!” Hopey howled, rushing at Diada.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
“Stop chawin’ on dat raw ham! Dat’ll gib you
<i>worms</i>, nigger!”</p>

<p>But Diada did not heed this warning. She cut
off a large hunk of the ham, then sat down and
devoured it like a dog.</p>

<p>“Hitch,” Hopey demanded, watching Diada with
popping eyeballs, “whut kind of nigger is dis?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Hitch murmured. “She muss be
some new kind of nigger. She come from furin
parts.”</p>

<p>“I can’t cook no vittles as long as I’s got to look
at dis circus coon,” Hopey declared. “I’s gwine
up-stairs an’ tell ole Mis’ Mildred!”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave her here wid me all by myse’f,
Hopey,” Hitch begged. “Take her wid you!”</p>

<p>Hopey walked over and laid her hand on Diada’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Come on here, you ole fool,” she said. “Why
don’t you ack like nobody else?”</p>


<h3>III<br />

ON THE RAMPAGE</h3>

<p>Mrs. Mildred Gaitskill was intensely interested
in social reforms, uplift movements, purity clubs,
and foreign missions. Colonel Tom Gaitskill had
often heard her remark that she had “felt a call”
to be a missionary to the heathen when she was
young; and Mr. Gaitskill, having a better recollection
of the characteristics of the superb girl he had
taken into his home thirty years before than she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of herself, was often tempted to tell her that she was
nothing but a civilized heathen when he married her.</p>

<p>She had just finished writing the last of twenty
invitations to the members of the Dunlap Missionary
Society. She began a note addressed to Dr. Sentelle,
the pastor of her church. After a few words of
explanation she wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I believe that Diada will be helpful in inspiring the
missionary ladies of our church with a greater love for
the dear heathen.</p>

<p>I have invited all the members of the society to my
home to-morrow evening at eight o’clock to see Diada
and have her reveal something of the customs of her
native land. Will you not honor us with your presence&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter writing was interrupted by the entrance
of Hopey and Diada&mdash;Hopey in the lead, puffing like
a tugboat towing an ocean liner.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Mildred,” she began, “I’s jes’ ’bleeged to
fotch dis here Whut-is-it up to yo’ room.”</p>

<p>“You refer to Diada?” Mrs. Gaitskill inquired
sweetly, her love for the dear heathen enveloping her
like a garment.</p>

<p>“Yes’m. Dis here Diader ain’t right in her haid.
Down in de kitchen she hauled off and throwed one
of my biscuit ag’in’ de wall an’ it <i>stuck</i>! She et a
whole half a ham <i>raw</i>! She swiped de butcher knife
right under my own <i>eyes</i>! She done ack powerful
scandalous, an’ ef she potters aroun’ my kitchen I
ain’t gwine <i>cook</i>!”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t know any better, Hopey,” Mrs.
Gaitskill told her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>“Yes’m. An’ you cain’t tell her nothin’ because
she’s plum’ deef ’n’ dum!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Mrs. Gaitskill smiled. “She can talk!
Can’t you, Diada?”</p>

<p>Diada leaned over the writing desk, picked up a
long, keen, pearl-handled paper knife and thrust it into
the folds of her dress; but she did not utter a word.</p>

<p>“Gimme dat knife, Dummy!” Hopey yelled
indignantly. “Whut you mean swipin’ ole mis’s
pretties? You keep up dat gait an’ de white folks
’ll tie you to a tree an’ you won’t git nothin’ to eat
fer a week, unless de woodpeckers feeds yer!”</p>

<p>Diada handed back the paper-cutter, but she kept
her eyes upon it covetously.</p>

<p>“Whut’s de matter wid dis coon, Mis’ Mildred?”
Hopey wanted to know.</p>

<p>“She’s a stranger from a strange land, Hopey,”
Mrs. Gaitskill replied. “She doesn’t understand our
ways.”</p>

<p>“She sho’ is strange,” Hopey affirmed with deep
conviction. “Look at her eyes an’ years an’ toofs
an’ nose! Look at her <i>stomick</i>&mdash;it don’t sag down
correck an’ it don’t stick out at de right place&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do, Hopey!” Mrs. Gaitskill said sharply.
“You must not comment on the personal appearance
of your guest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She sho’ is a guess&mdash;Mis’ Mildred. She’s got
me guessin’!”</p>

<p>“Place a chair by the window, Hopey,” Mrs.
Gaitskill said. “I’ll keep Diada with me.”</p>

<p>“<i>Which?</i>” Hopey howled. “You gwine let dat
coon set in yo’ boodwar in one dese gold cheers?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>Hopey placed a rocking-chair by the window and
motioned Diada to sit down.</p>

<p>“Set easy, Diader!” she commanded sharply.
“Yo’ whole hide couldn’t hold as much money as
dat cheer costed. An’ do yo’ manners, nigger!
You is de onlies’ coon whutever set down in ole Mis’
Mildred’s settin’-room!”</p>

<p>She turned and walked down-stairs, informing
Hitch Diamond in tragic tones that Mrs. Gaitskill
had “done gone cripple under de hat.”</p>

<p>Peering through the branches of a large pecan-tree
which stood beside the window, Diada could see
the purple haze which hung above the Little Moccasin
Swamp. Charmed by this vision she settled
back in her chair and remained perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaitskill sealed all her envelopes; then finding
that she lacked a sufficient number of stamps walked
down-stairs to the library. The instant she left the
room Diada stepped out on the window-sill, poised
for a moment, and leaped with the agility of a monkey
from the window to a heavy branch of the pecan-tree.
Slipping quickly to the ground she started
for the Little Moccasin Swamp.</p>

<p>Avoiding the streets of Tickfall by a detour, she
struck into a long, swinging, tireless trot, as rapid
as the gallop of a mustang, and in twenty minutes
swung off into the bridle-path which led to
the Gaitskill hog-camp. Her long skirts hindered
her by catching upon the briers and underbrush.
She stopped, rolled her skirts up above the knees,
knotted them into place by a deft twist, then trotted
on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>Standing under the shadow of a live-oak-tree on
the Little Moccasin ridge, holding a double-barreled,
muzzle-loading shotgun, was a diminutive darky
named Little Bit. His eager eyes were searching
the branches of a hickory tree for an elusive gray
squirrel. Little Bit was afraid of snakes, varmints,
his own shadow, and “ha’nts.”</p>

<p>“Dis shore is a lonesome place,” he chattered to
himself. “I’s got snake-dust in my shoes, an’ a
buckeye in my pocket, an’ a buzzard’s feather in my
hat&mdash;but I ain’t feel like nothin’ cain’t happen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Twenty yards away Diada stood in the shadow
of another tree watching him. She was very much
interested in the little negro, who had his back to
her. With absolutely noiseless tread she approached
him&mdash;her intentions most friendly and peaceable.
When she was ten feet away Little Bit turned around
and saw her.</p>

<p>The features of Little Bit’s face first expanded,
then contracted, then resolved into a heterogeneous
mass expressive of more conflicting emotions than
he had ever before experienced. The gun fell from
his hands and dropped with the barrel resting across
his toes. Even in his agony of fright he was conscious
of Diada’s shortened skirt, and beheld her big, brown
knees, knotted and gnarled like the trunk of a black
gum-tree. With a trembling hand he reached upward
for his hat&mdash;a sure sign he was getting ready
to go away from there at his best speed.</p>

<p>Like a flash he wheeled and raced bareheaded
down the ridge, slapping his hat against his thigh at
every step like a jockey lashing his mount. In a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
moment he merged himself like a brown, fleeting
shadow among the shadows of the overarching trees.
Diada picked up the gun, holding it like a club, and
striking her tireless trot, followed in his tracks.</p>

<p>Old Isaiah, the venerable negro superintendent of
the Gaitskill hog-camp, sat upon the porch of the
cabin sunning his rheumatic legs when Little Bit
came racing across the clearing at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>“Save my life, Isaiah!” Little Bit shrieked.
“She’s a comin’!”</p>

<p>“Sot down, Little Bit,” Isaiah remarked in a
sleepy tone. “You gits at least one good skeer
eve’y day. Now set yo’ triggers an’ take good aim,
an’ git at de right eend of de gun befo’ you shoots
her off! Who’s a comin’?”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows!” Little Bit moaned.</p>

<p>“Whut do she look like?” Isaiah demanded.</p>

<p>“She don’t favor nothin’ or nobody!” Little Bit
sighed. “<i>Oo-ee!</i> Her’s got on shoes an’ socks, but
her dress is cut bobtail&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped with a shriek. Diada, carrying his
gun, came walking sedately across the clearing
toward the cabin.</p>

<p>Isaiah gazed upon her for a second, then slowly
raised himself to his feet, and with the explosive
force of a steam-whistle, he bellowed:</p>

<p>“My&mdash;good&mdash;gosh!”</p>

<p>He ran to the side of the house where an ax reposed
upon the wood-pile. Seizing this, he flourished
it in a threatening manner and bawled:</p>

<p>“Hey, dar! Stop! Hol’ up! Quit yo’ foolin’!”</p>

<p>Diada paid no heed to these admonitions, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
continued her advance, holding Little Bit’s gun by
the end of the barrel and swinging it like a club.</p>

<p>“Throw a chunk at her, Little Bit!” Isaiah howled.
“Skeer her away!”</p>

<p>The boy snatched up a pebble, hurled it at Diada,
and ducked under the house.</p>

<p>Diada stopped. Beholding Isaiah’s threatening
gestures with the ax, she whirled the gun around her
head like a cowboy preparing to hurl a lasso, and
threw it, butt-foremost, at Isaiah. The weapon
curved like an arrow, missed Isaiah’s head by two
feet, struck against the side of the cabin, smashing
the gun-butt to splinters and discharging both
barrels!</p>

<p>Thereupon Isaiah and Little Bit departed from
the hog-camp and did not come back for two days.</p>

<p>The sound of the explosion frightened Diada, and
she leaped back into the jungle like a deer, struck
the Tickfall trail, and one hour later sat down beneath
the pecan-tree in Gaitskill’s yard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late that night Colonel Tom Gaitskill stuck his
head into the door of his wife’s bedroom and demanded
in irascible tones:</p>

<p>“Mildred, where are those sky-muckle-dun-colored
pajamas young Tom sent me from Chicago?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Mrs. Gaitskill laughed. “Have
you looked for them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I can’t find ’em. Come and help me
hunt!”</p>

<p>Two minutes later Mrs. Gaitskill stuck her head
into her husband’s room and demanded:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>“Where is my silk flowered kimono? Is it in your
room?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“I can’t find that kimono anywhere!”</p>

<p>The two began a search, but the missing articles
were not found. When finally they abandoned the
hunt, Gaitskill sighed in relief:</p>

<p>“I hope those pajamas are gone for good. Young
Tom was a fool to send me such a slosh of color as
they were&mdash;made me look like a soused rainbow!”</p>


<h3>IV<br />

A KIMONO-CLAD APPARITION</h3>

<p>The next evening, promptly at eight o’clock, the
members of the Dunlap Missionary Society began to
arrive. Then Colonel Tom Gaitskill became uneasy
and sought out his wife:</p>

<p>“Mildred, are you planning to bring that cannibal
wench into the drawing-room and show her off?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Tom,” she replied. “That’s why I
invited the ladies here&mdash;to see Diada.”</p>

<p>“Have you talked to her about it?”</p>

<p>“No. How could I? I’ve dressed her nicely, and
she’s&mdash;well&mdash;tolerably presentable.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard her say a word?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Does she appear to understand what you say?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I don’t know,” Mrs. Gaitskill answered.</p>

<p>Gaitskill rubbed his hand across his forehead, then
swept it down his long, white beard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>“All right, Mildred,” he grinned. “It’s your
obsequies. But I hope that dear heathen won’t
perform any circus stunts.”</p>

<p>The conversation was brought to a close by the
arrival of the Reverend Dr. Sentelle, an aged, feeble,
badly crippled man, who leaned heavily upon his
walking stick as he entered the door.</p>

<p>That walking stick was a curiosity. At the large
end it was as big around as an average man’s leg,
tapering slightly toward the lower end, and weighing
eleven pounds! Thus spoke the owner about it:</p>

<p>“Sir, this stick came from the battlefield of
Shiloh. I was wounded in that battle, sir, and as
you can observe, have been a cripple ever since. I
fell beneath a dogwood tree and lay there for nearly
two days. After the surrender, sir, I returned to the
battlefield and cut down that tree and have carried
it ever since as a walking stick. The tree was fertilized
by my blood, sir, and it is only just that it should
bear my infirmities.”</p>

<p>While imparting this information, it was the
invariable custom of the venerable preacher to catch
his stick by the little end and emphasize his remarks
by waving it above his auditor’s head. And as he
could not stand for any length of time without his
cane, it was a common thing to see him during his
pulpit discourses reverse his stick and shake it at the
heads of his congregation, exactly as many an irate
baseball player has punctuated his remarks to the
fans in the grand stand by flourishing a bat.</p>

<p>As Dr. Sentelle entered the room upon the arm of
Colonel Gaitskill, the guests knew that all were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
present who had been invited. They stiffened in
their seats. They had heard much about Diada
since her arrival in Tickfall and they were awed to
an electric silence of waiting, holding themselves
in smiling readiness for the entrance of the stranger
from the cannibal islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The minutes passed. The silence became oppressive.
Colonel Gaitskill jiggled his feet. Then
through the open window came the voice of Mrs.
Gaitskill:</p>

<p>“Hopey, have you seen Diada?”</p>

<p>“No’m. I ain’t saw her. I ain’t pesterin’ my
mind ’bout her. Dat nigger ain’t my kind of black
folks!”</p>

<p>“Go find Diada at once! Bring her into the
drawing-room! Hear me!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I’ll fotch her in!”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Mrs. Gaitskill entered the
drawing-room alone. The situation was embarrassing,
but Mrs. Gaitskill was not even slightly flustered.
She possessed an immense reserve of coolness which
contrasted sharply on this occasion with the painful
distraction of her husband.</p>

<p>The minutes passed&mdash;leaden minutes. Some of
the guests made a pretense of little conversational
flurries.</p>

<p>“Our missionaries are so heroic&mdash;The lecture was
so edifying&mdash;How they must love their work&mdash;I
have often felt a call&mdash;Their lives are very lonely&mdash;Sacrifice
and service&mdash;My daughter shows such a
fine missionary spirit&mdash;I tell Eula&mdash;The lovely
cannibals&mdash;I always say&mdash;Of course&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>These hushed, tentative fragments of conversation
were interrupted by the triumphant, booming
voice of Hopey:</p>

<p>“Hey, dar&mdash;you deef ’n’ dum’ nigger! Whut you
mean by keepin’ Mis’ Mildred’s comp’ny waitin’?
Ain’t you got no manners?”</p>

<p>Still the minutes passed.</p>

<p>Colonel Gaitskill became quite distraught, and
excusing himself, slipped up-stairs and helped himself
to the contents of a private decanter. He came
back to face the same intense, expectant silence
which some of the guests attempted to relieve by
exchanging seats with other guests. Once more
there were scattering efforts at normal talk:</p>

<p>“The Christmas ship to the Belgians&mdash;Splendid
missionary spirit&mdash;I haven’t much to give&mdash;I
told her God loves the dear cannibals&mdash;Home and
foreign&mdash;All the chickens I took from under the
setting hen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Git on up dem front steps!” Hopey howled, as if
she were driving a pig. “Go on in dat front do’!
Hurry!”</p>

<p>The front door opened and Diada entered, advanced
to the center of the drawing-room, and
stopped.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the peculiar sound
which was emitted from the throats of the twenty
women at their first sight of Diada.</p>

<p>Her physical ugliness was deplorable and appalling;
but that which produced the peculiar utterance
from the missionary ladies was this:</p>

<p>Diada was clothed in Mrs. Gaitskill’s light-blue,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
pink-flowered kimono, and beneath that she wore
Colonel Gaitskill’s sky-muckle-dun-colored pajamas!</p>

<p>Diada was six feet tall, and the kimono ended just
below her knee and flared wide open in front, for two
garments of the same size could not have enveloped
her. The pajamas ended just above Diada’s black
shoes and revealed about four inches of her stocking&mdash;the
shoes and stockings being all that she now
wore of the garments with which Mrs. Gaitskill had
originally clothed her for the reception.</p>

<p>Diada stared about her for a moment, then sat
down upon the piano seat.</p>

<p>Her ponderous elbow struck the keys with a crashing
discord, and Diada gave forth a sound expressive
of delight&mdash;it sounded like the snort of an elephant.
Then using her elbows instead of her hands, the
dear immortal heathen proceeded to make the most
unheavenly noise that ever vexed the ears of Christian
missionaries, home or foreign.</p>

<p>In the midst of this horrifying situation, Hopey
entered the drawing-room, her hands resting upon
her hips, her mouth bawling voluble apologies:</p>

<p>“My Gawd, Mis’ Mildred! I ain’t to blame fer
dis here turr’ble sight! I foun’ Diader settin’ under
de pecan tree in de dark, an’ I couldn’t tell whut she
had on till she done open dat front do’ an’ went in
whar de light wus shinin’. Lawdamussy! Diader
favors a scrambled circus band-waggin!”</p>

<p>The ladies of the missionary society covered their
faces with their flimsy, transparent handkerchiefs,
and kept up that peculiar sound of outraged modesty.</p>

<p>Then Diada broke out in a new place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>Still pounding on the piano with her naked elbows,
she began to sing&mdash;singing with a voice which caused
the tiny threads in the electric-light globes to quiver
and grow dim, and wrought such havoc in the ears
of the missionary women that they followed Diada’s
heathen music with a Christian accompaniment of
startling yelps, like the frightened squeaks one hears
at the county fair when the unsophisticated village
maidens loop the loop or dip the dip or hear the wild
man of Borneo roar.</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill sprang to his feet, seized
Dr. Sentelle’s walking stick by the little end, and
flourished it at Hopey.</p>

<p>“Hopey!” he whooped to be heard above the
noise, “you take that&mdash;infernal&mdash;female&mdash;wench out
of this house. Do it now! I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Diada turned around and looked at Colonel Gaitskill.
She beheld an immense club flourished threateningly
above her head. On the day before, she had
seen old Isaiah at the hog-camp waving an ax at her
with the same menacing gesture.</p>

<p>With a loud whoop, Diada sprang across the
drawing-room, dived headfirst through a large plateglass
window, ran across the yard, and departed from
Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s hospitable home forever.</p>


<h3>V<br />

HITCH ENLISTS THE PARSON’S AID</h3>

<p>On the following morning, Mrs. Tom Gaitskill had
a real cause for worry: Diada could not be found and
was last seen going toward the Little Moccasin Swamp.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>This swamp was twelve miles long and eight wide,
traversed by winding streams of slow-moving, oily,
yellow water, abounding with quagmires, full of
poisonous vines and deadly serpents, the feeding
range of wild hogs as vicious as wolves. It was a
man-trap, a dreadful place to all except the most
experienced woodsmen. Many a hunter had led
his squirrel-dog into that swamp, and only the dog
found his way back home. The man’s friends found
him a few days later by watching the spiral flight
of the buzzards concentrating at one spot in the
jungle.</p>

<p>“Tom,” Mrs. Gaitskill exclaimed in anxious tones,
“you must send Hitch Diamond after Diada at
once!”</p>

<p>“Let her go!” Gaitskill replied indifferently.
“I’m surfeited with her society. Maybe she’ll come
back after a while.”</p>

<p>“You know she will not, Tom,” Mrs. Gaitskill
protested with glistening eyes. “If she is not captured
before she gets too deep in that swamp, she
is gone forever.”</p>

<p>“If she took my pajamas with her, I’m fully resigned
to the will of the Lord,” Gaitskill grinned.
“They’re gone forever, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” Mrs. Gaitskill begged, her fine face
flushed with mortification. “Oh, those garments
in my reception-room&mdash;I can’t bear to think of them!
But we can’t let her wander off in that swamp and
die.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send Hitch after her&mdash;if he’ll go,” Gaitskill
said, and walked back toward the rear of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
house, where he located Hitch, not by sight, but
by sound:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My wife’s strong-minded,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She’s double-j’inded,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She ain’t tame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Scan’lize my name&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The negro ceased singing, jerked off his big hat,
and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Hitch,” Gaitskill began, “Diada ran away last
night. I want you to find her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; Hopey narrate me about dat.”</p>

<p>“Go out into the swamp and find her!” Gaitskill
commanded.</p>

<p>Hitch sat down and scratched his head; he plowed
up the dirt with the toe of his ponderous boot; he
slapped at the flies with his hat. He was trying to
think up a plausible lie as an excuse for declining the
proffered job.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, Marse Tom,” he said slowly. “I’s
powerful sorry, but I jes’ nachelly, can’t go&mdash;er&mdash;de
lodge meets to-night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll be back before night,” Gaitskill assured
him.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, but I gotter hustle aroun’ an’ git some
money to pay my dues&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay your dues.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, but&mdash;er&mdash;I gotter had my lodge clothes
cleaned an’ pressed, an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get some nigger to do that for you. I’ll pay
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>Hitch stopped. His resources were exhausted.
He looked at Gaitskill with a face as expressionless
as a glass-eyed doll. “Marse Tom is sho’ a quick
ketcher,” he thought. Then he spoke aloud:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, I jes’ nachelly don’t wanter go atter
dat coon! Why don’t you an’ me jes’ let her ramble?
Us kind of folks hadn’t oughter pay dat nigger no
pertick’ler mind&mdash;she ain’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Gaitskill turned and walked away.</p>

<p>He was too much in sympathy with Hitch’s argument
to discuss the matter. He salved his conscience
with the reflection that he had told Hitch to go,
although he was pretty sure that Hitch would slip
off down-town, stay hid all day, and return at night
to report that he had failed to find Diada.</p>

<p>But contrary to Gaitskill’s expectations, Hitch did
some heavy thinking, then sought out the Rev.
Vinegar Atts, pastor of the Shoofly church.</p>

<p>“Elder,” he began, “does you b’lieve in cornvertin’
de heathen?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Atts replied, scenting a contribution
for foreign missions.</p>

<p>“Well, suh,” Hitch declared, “now is de choosen
time to get right nex’ to a shore-’nuff she-heathen.
Marse Tom is got her out to his house on a little
visit, an’ las’ night de Revun Sentelle an’ all de
miss’nary ladies of Marse Tom’s chu’ch was makin’
’miration over dat coon, an’ I figgers dat us Mef’dis
niggers oughter jub’late too.”</p>

<p>“Shorely, shorely!” Vinegar Atts boomed. “Whar
is dis here she-heathen at?”</p>

<p></p>

<p>“Her’s gone out fer a walk in de Little Moccasin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Swamp,” Hitch informed him. “Ef us walks out
to’des de swamp, ’pears to me we mought meet up
wid her an’ git real good acquainted.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s good argufyin’,” Vinegar responded, reaching
for his hat. “Whut do she look like?”</p>

<p>“Her looks like us niggers&mdash;only ’bout fawty’leben
times more!” Hitch told him.</p>

<p>“Kin she talk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, but a feller cain’t ketch on to nothin’
she specifies. It’s a kind of jibber-jabber monkeytalk
dat lubricates a whole lot, but it don’t show
whar at!” Hitch informed him, wondering at the
same time how she really did talk&mdash;for Hitch had
never heard a sound from her throat.</p>

<p>“Ef she cain’t talk to us, an’ we cain’t talk to her,
we shore ain’t gwine fuss an’ fall out!” Vinegar
declared.</p>

<p>The big, fat, squat-legged preacher trotted along
beside the giant prize-fighter toward the swamp, and
by the time they turned off the main road on to the
bridle-path which led to the Gaitskill hog-camp,
Hitch had told the preacher as much about Diada
as he thought Vinegar ought to know. Needless to
say, he did not mention her ugliness, her size, her
love for raw meat, nor his own overwhelming fear
of her.</p>

<p>“Whut’s de matter wid dis swamp, Hitch?”
Vinegar demanded, gazing at the trees and wiping
the copious sweat from his face.</p>

<p>The swamp had suddenly become as hot as an
anteroom to hell. The trees had lost their green
sparkle, assuming the colors of decay&mdash;corpseyellow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
and livid green, shining with an oily, sickening
glitter.</p>

<p>Hitch shuddered. It was easy for him to believe
that Diada had conjured the swamp and had caused
it to assume this aspect of menace.</p>

<p>“Less hump along to’des de hog-camp, Revun!” he
exclaimed. “I’s skeart of dis place. I been talkin’
to hear my tongue rattle, but now I kin shet my mouf
an’ hear my jaws rattle.”</p>

<p>Something scared the birds in the jungle and they
flew shriekingly from tree to tree, all going in the
same direction.</p>

<p>Submerged among the immense trees of the jungle
the negroes could not tell what was happening in the
heavens, but they noticed that the sun had changed,
no longer spraying off of the tops of the trees like
falling water, and the path at their feet had become
almost invisible in the darkness.</p>

<p>A wind suddenly swept through the forest, cold
as a breeze from the arctic icebergs. Every tree
and shrub leaned away from that icy blast, and vines
which trailed the ground for hundreds of feet slowly
rose up and whirled and writhed in the air like long,
slim snakes. In twenty seconds that one puff of
wind had passed and there was no more, and the
scalding heat rose from the ground like steam from
the boiling caldrons of Tophet.</p>

<p>At any other time, Hitch Diamond would have
known that a Southern rain-storm was coming and
would have paid no attention to it except to seek a
cleared spot in the forest, where the dead limbs falling
from the trees could not impale him to the ground.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>But now his fear was superstitious, and it became
infectious to Vinegar Atts and the two raced before
the storm like catboats on a wind-swept lake.</p>

<p>Then the rain fell&mdash;fell exactly as if some great
Titan’s hands had lifted up the silver bowl of the
Gulf of Mexico and emptied its contents on their
heads. The first big drop felt like a bucketful and
seemed to wet them all over.</p>

<p>From that moment they stumbled rather than ran,
simply fell forward, caught themselves, and fell
forward again&mdash;who could run under Niagara’s
tumbling flood?</p>

<p>And thus they ran blindly into the august presence
of Diada!</p>

<p>Just as another icy blast swept through the jungle,
lasting for twenty seconds and stopping the rain, the
two men looked up and beheld Diada, facing the
breeze, standing in their path like a rooted tree.
She still wore Mrs. Gaitskill’s light-blue, pink-flowered
kimono, and that gaudy garment trailed
out behind her and snapped in the breeze, resembling
the variegated tail of some enormous tropic bird.</p>

<p>To the astounded men Diada looked as big as a
skinned mule.</p>

<p>With a shriek Hitch Diamond dodged around her,
leading Vinegar Atts in the flight by a nose, and the
two men ran on toward the hog-camp&mdash;the falling
rain thundering around them like the sound of a
troop of cavalry crossing a wooden bridge.</p>

<p>As they plunged across the open clearing in front
of the cabin Hitch looked back.</p>

<p>Diada was forty steps behind him, trotting easily,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
covering incredible space with each step, her horrible
mouth twisted into a cannibal grin. But it did not
look like a grin to Hitch&mdash;those immense, protruding
teeth and the repulsively thick lips curled back
above and beneath them reminded him of nothing so
much as the mouth of an angry, biting jackass.</p>

<p>“Here she comes, Vinegar!” Hitch bawled. “Come
in an’ shet de do’!”</p>

<p>But they were too late. Diada’s foot struck the
bottom step of the little porch just as Hitch reached
the top step. Diada grasped Hitch by the coattail
and was towed into the house by that frightened giant
who promptly shucked off his coat as he passed
through the door and let Diada have it.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts turned around and took a long look
at Diada. He reeled back against the wall, covered
his eyes with his hands, and in horror-stricken tones
he bellowed:</p>

<p>“Come here, Hitch, an’ he’p me! Somepin’ is
done happened to my eyesight&mdash;I ain’t seein’ right!”</p>


<h3>VI<br />

PLACATING A DERVISH</h3>

<p>Outside the wind and rain roared like a hurricane
and great lumps of hail struck upon the solid roof of
the cabin like brickbats, rolled off, and hit the ground
with a loud click.</p>

<p>Large particles of hail, looking as if a number of
lumps had met and merged in mid-air, fell down the
large open chimney, and rolled out upon the floor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
On any other occasion Hitch and Vinegar would
have pounced upon them, but now neither moved to
pick them up.</p>

<p>The three rain-drenched people stood in the middle
of the floor, each in the center of a widening puddle;
then they relieved the strain by changing their
location and began to drip in a new puddle.</p>

<p>At last Vinegar’s legs sank under him, and he
dropped upon a chair.</p>

<p>“Oo-ee!” he sighed. “De good Lawd sho’ is
made a mistake when He fotch me into dis here
tangle-up. He’s done got my tail caught in a cuttin’-box.”</p>

<p>“Talk to her, Revun!” Hitch begged in an agonized
whisper.</p>

<p>“You cornverse her, Hitch,” Vinegar Atts pleaded.
“I’ll set right here by you an’ pray constant.”</p>

<p>Diada walked to the fireplace, squatted down,
picked up two splinters of wood and rubbed them
together. A tiny blue flame curled around the
fingers of the woman. Sheltering the flame with her
hands, she added more fuel, and in a moment stepped
back from a roaring fire.</p>

<p>“Look at dat!” Hitch Diamond exclaimed in tones
of wonder and admiration. “Made a fire by rubbin’
two sticks ag’in’ each odder. I done tried dat a
thousan’ times, but I didn’t make nothin’ but sweat!”</p>

<p>“Whut you reckin she done built dat fire fer,
Hitch?” Vinegar inquired with chattering teeth.</p>

<p>“Mebbe she wants to dry out dem clothes she’s
got on,” Hitch surmised.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Vinegar responded in fearful tones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
“It ’pears to me dat it’s mighty nigh dinner-time,
an’ I’s done heerd tell dat sometimes dose here she-heathens
<i>eats folks</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, nigger!” Hitch mourned, sinking
down upon a bench at the far end of the room.
“Don’t start no news like dat! Please, suh, Revun
Atts, git yo’ religium wuckin’ ag’in’ her right now!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how!” Vinegar lamented. “I
ain’t never had no expe’unce on dis kind of job.”</p>

<p>“Whut do de Bible say do?” Hitch demanded.</p>

<p>“It say, ‘Watch an’ pray,’” Vinegar told him.</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t gwine do no good in dis case,” Hitch
declared with conviction. “You mought as well
pour dem advices back into de jug. Leasewise I
cain’t figger out how it kin do any good. But ef
you wants to try it, you do de prayin’ an’ lemme
watch.”</p>

<p>“I’s mos’ too close to dis fire, Hitch,” Vinegar remarked
uneasily. “I prefers to pray in de kitchen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go wid you,” Hitch declared eagerly.</p>

<p>The two men entered the only other room to the
log cabin, each blocking the other in his eagerness to
be the first to get through the door. Diada promptly
followed them, and the two men backed against the
wall, looking in vain for some way of escape for
Diada was between them and the door.</p>

<p>Hanging from the rafters in the kitchen were half
a dozen strings of smoked sausages in skins.</p>

<p>Diada reached up and clawed down one of the
strings and proceeded to eat the sausage raw. Like
a child chewing a thread, she began at one end and
lapped up link after link of the sausage. When that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
had been devoured, she snatched down another
string and began on the end of that. Then she
snapped off a link and offered it to Vinegar Atts.</p>

<p>“No’m; thank ’e, mum,” Vinegar said. “I likes
to watch you chawin’ it. Fer Gawd’s sake, don’t
nibble at dat sausage like dat&mdash;<i>eat a plenty</i>!”</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond pulled down two more strings of
the sausage and handed them to her.</p>

<p>“Honey,” he said in wheedling tones, “don’t
encourage no delicate appetite. Fill up&mdash;fill up!
Wallop up dem sassages till you git whar you cain’t
do nothin’ but chaw because yo’ swaller is full up
to de top. Den, bless Gawd, dar won’t be no room
in yo’ insides fer me!”</p>

<p>“Huh.” Vinegar Atts grunted, “I’d rather had a
jackass chaw me dan dat baboon. Look at her
toofs!”</p>

<p>At last Diada concluded her feast, tossed the
undevoured links of sausage on the floor and started
back toward the other room. The two men followed
because there was nothing else to do. When they
had seated themselves before the fire Vinegar said:</p>

<p>“Hitch, talk to her a little bit an’ git her feelin’
good, an’ mebbe her’ll let us go back to town.”</p>

<p>“I dunno how to begin,” Hitch complained.
“Ef a cullud lady won’t talk, seems like I cain’t git no
hand-holt to remark nothin’ to her.”</p>

<p>“Ax her inquirements!” Vinegar advised.</p>

<p>There was silence in the cabin while Hitch explored
his brain for a suitable question to ask. Outside the
raidn fell in a torrent and the jungle roared like thunder.
Finally Hitch spoke:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>“Diader, does you enjoy yo’ meals in dis country?”</p>

<p>Diada did not answer, but Vinegar Atts did.</p>

<p>“Git away from de subjeck of grub, Hitch. De
sausages is done all been et mighty nigh, an’ whut is
dis she-heathen got to eat fer supper but <i>us</i>?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine be here fer supper!” Hitch informed
him.</p>

<p>“Me neither&mdash;ef I makes no mistake,” Vinegar
replied earnestly. “Go on wid dem inquirements!”</p>

<p>Hitch took a new start:</p>

<p>“Does you had a good time, Diader? Enj’y
yo’se’f?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe dat ain’t no polite question to ax dis kind
of coon,” Vinegar remarked when Diada made no
answer. “Try somepin diffunt, Hitch!”</p>

<p>“How old is you, Diader?” Hitch asked desperately.</p>

<p>A discreet silence on the part of Diada.</p>

<p>“I knowed you pulled de stopper outen de wrong
bottle <i>dat</i> time!” Vinegar commented. “Ax her
somepin ’bout her kinnery!”</p>

<p>“Wus yo’ maw an’ paw feelin’ tol’able when you
seed ’em las’?” Hitch inquired timidly.</p>

<p>To all appearances Diada had not heard.</p>

<p>“Mebbe all her kinnery’s in jail,” Vinegar declared.
“Anyway, she don’t wanter talk about ’em. Stop
axin’ fool questions, Hitch! You put yo’ foot in it
eve’y time you opens yo’ mouf!”</p>

<p>“Looky here, Revun!” Hitch retorted in irate tones.
“I fotch you out here wid me to cornvert dis here
heathen. You brag yo’ brags dat you could, now
lemme see you git at it! You ain’t axed her nothin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
since you come&mdash;jes’ been rubber-neckin’ at her like
a goggle-eye perch. Now you git busy on dis dam’
ole baboon an’ ’suade her to be a Christian like us is!”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Vinegar Atts took a big breath,
stared timidly at Diada’s feet, and began:</p>

<p>“Diada, does you foller up de chu’ch?”</p>

<p>“Git pussonal, Revun, git pussonal!” Hitch advised,
when Diada did not reply. “Stop beatin’ de
bush aroun’ de debbil.”</p>

<p>“Diader, does you take up wid religion?” Vinegar
inquired. But Diada made no reply.</p>

<p>“Ax her do she <i>expe’unce</i> religion!” the prize-fighter
prompted the preacher. “Ax her do she
know dat she’s a chile of Gawd!”</p>

<p>“Diader,” Vinegar asked timidly, “is you got
any shore an’ certain hopes of heaven?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right! Git pussonal!” Hitch applauded.</p>

<p>But Diada steadfastly refused to make any confession
of faith.</p>

<p>“Ax her is she committed any sins!” Hitch suggested.
“Git pussonal!”</p>

<p>“Looky here, Hitch!” the preacher complained.
“I don’t know how dis cullud pusson sets her table
an’ I’s skeart I’ll fall in de soup. Whut’s de use
axin’ pussonal inquirements when a feller don’t git
no kind of respondunce nohow?”</p>

<p>He leaned back, his face overshadowed with gloom
and fear. He thrust his hand into his pockets, and
his face suddenly cleared.</p>

<p>“I got her now, Hitch! Look at dis!”</p>

<p>Vinegar held up a small round mirror with an
advertisement on the back. He looked at himself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
then passed it to Hitch, who examined his own
features carefully, and who then passed the mirror to
Diada.</p>

<p>With wondering faces the two men watched the
eternal savage feminine to see if it was like the other
kind of eternal feminine. It was.</p>

<p>Diada placed the mirror about four inches from
one big, protruding eye, squinted into the glass, and
then slipped the little mirror into her hair, gave the
hair a deft twist, and brought her hands down&mdash;empty.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Vinegar mourned. “My little lookin’-glass
is plum’ gone, jes’ as good as ef she’d
swallered it!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Hitch agreed. “Diader shore
made a short cut-off.”</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to the ceiling in an attitude of
religious resignation, and saw Little Bit’s mandolin
hanging on a nail above his head. He reached up
and took it down.</p>

<p>Seating himself, he swept his fingers across the
strings. Diada’s mouth opened in a wide grin.</p>

<p>“I’s got her. Vinegar,” Hitch boomed. “Now
I’s gwine fetch her a few lively toons, an’ while I
plays you open dat do’. Mebbe I kin sing dis heathen
chile to sleep, but ef I cain’t, you keep yo’ eye on
me an’ git ready to scoot!”</p>

<p>Hitch got busy with the mandolin, and Vinegar
availed himself of the first opportunity and opened
the door. The rain had ceased, and from the hot
ground a fog had risen like steam so thick and heavy
that objects were invisible at a distance of twenty feet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>Hitch sang a few songs, and at the conclusion of
each song he moved back from the fire under pretense
of being too warm; but he moved every time a little
closer to the open door.</p>

<p>Then Diada rose and began a weird, awkward
dance, marking the steps by a peculiar guttural
sound like a grunt. Under the weight of her ponderous
tramping feet the cabin trembled. The negroes
trembled, too, but they were having a chill. In a
moment their fright had assumed the proportions
and powers of a dynamo propelling them out of that
cabin.</p>

<p>“Git ready, Vinegar!” Hitch howled, as he madly
played and sang. “I’s done got in de notion to
skedaddle. When I gives de word, you better do
it!”</p>

<p>Diada had begun to whirl like a dancing Dervish.
Mrs. Gaitskill’s silk kimono stood straight out from
her mighty shoulders and Colonel Gaitskill’s pajamas
became a blear of color in her mad gyration.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts rose and walked toward the door.
Hitch Diamond stood up, thumping madly upon the
strings of his musical instrument, watching his
chance.</p>

<p>Just when the two men were ready to bolt Diada
whooped, sprang through the door, leaped into the
open space in front of the porch, and continued her
mad rotary dance. There was a flash of steel, and
from somewhere on her person Diada produced what
Hitch recognized as Mrs. Gaitskill’s pearl-handled
paper-cutter, and the large steel carving-knife which
Hopey used in the kitchen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Then began a dance of steel which filled the negroes
with horror.</p>

<p>Diada tossed the knives in the air where they
whirled like steel wheels, and beneath them she
continued her wild gyrations; with wonderful skill,
she kept the two blades in the air above her, catching
them unerringly when they fell and tossing them up
again, while a strange, guttural shriek emanated
from her throat, curdling the blood in the veins of
Vinegar Atts and Hitch Diamond.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hitch Diamond bellowed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Good-by ma honey! I’ve run out of money<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Good-by, ma honey&mdash;I’m <i>gone</i>!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before the mandolin, which Hitch hurled from
him, had struck the ground, he and Vinegar were
half-way across the clearing and a race-horse could
not have caught them for their first mile of travel
back to town.</p>

<p>Pounding up the street toward the Tickfall courthouse,
Hitch Diamond spoke for the first time in
seven miles:</p>

<p>“Elder Atts, I don’t b’lieve you really favors furin
missions!”</p>


<h3>VII<br />

ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS</h3>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill and Dr. Sentelle stood
on the street in front of the court house discussing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the missionary meeting of the evening before and
the sudden departure of Diada.</p>

<p>“Do you think Diada’s visit will quicken the
missionary activities of the women of our church?”
Dr. Sentelle laughed.</p>

<p>“Who knows?” Gaitskill grinned. “She certainly
made an impression on me! An escaped heathen
running at large in the vicinity of Tickfall might
quicken all kinds of activities&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Their attention was diverted by the sight of two
negroes who stumbled down the middle of the street
in the last stages of exhaustion, puffing like steamboats,
covered with swamp-mud, their garments
torn to shreds by their flight through the vines and
underbrush.</p>

<p>“Hey&mdash;Hitch!” Gaitskill called.</p>

<p>The two negroes stopped, staggered to where
Gaitskill was standing, and sank down upon the
curbstone at his feet.</p>

<p>“We done got away, Marse Tom!” Hitch Diamond
panted. “Us escaped jes’ like de Bible say&mdash;wid
de skin off our teeth.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p>“Me an’ Vinegar is been huntin’ dat Diader you
sent me atter dis mawnin’,” Hitch answered; then
in a tone of sharp complaint: “Marse Tom, whut
you makin’ all dis splutter ’bout dat varmint fur?
She ain’t right in her intellectuals!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ve been anywhere near that
swamp,” Gaitskill grinned.</p>

<p>“We shore has, Marse Tom,” the negroes said in
one breath. Then they began a recitation of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
experiences, snatching the sentences out of each
other’s mouths:</p>

<p>“She built a fire by rubbin’ two sticks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She et raw sassages&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She danced a jig in dat cabin wid butcher-knives&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She had on a chop-tailed nightshirt&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“An’ cute little pants jes’ de color of a rotten egg
busted on ’em&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Their recitation was interrupted by the sound of
galloping hoofs. Two mules were coming down the
road at full speed, one mule ridden by a bent-shouldered
old man whose kinky white wool fitted his
head like a rubber cap, and the other ridden by a
diminutive, pop-eyed boy so black he could shut his
eyes and become almost invisible.</p>

<p>At every jump the riders belabored their mules
with clubs, thus giving them additional reasons why
they should accelerate their operations; and even
the mules seemed to realize that it was an urgent
case.</p>

<p>They shook their heads, groaned like elephants
in distress, and seemed to measure off ten or fifteen
feet at a leap. The riders jolted to and fro like two
gray squirrels in the storm-tossed branches of a tree,
but they hung on to the shaggy manes of their
mounts with one hand and operated their clubs with
the other.</p>

<p>“Hey, you niggers!” Gaitskill called. “<i>Whoa!</i>”</p>

<p>The mules, hearing that last command, stopped.</p>

<p>Now when a mule stops, he stops with a suddenness;
he stops all over and all at once; he stops like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
wet dish-rag which drops upon the floor, like a stepladder
which collapses and comes down flat upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The mules stopped.</p>

<p>Isaiah and Little Bit did not. They went on.
They dived ungracefully over the heads of their
mules, struck the ground twenty feet ahead of them,
rolled over and over in the moist sand, then got
up in a most solemn and dignified manner, walked
sedately to the spot where Vinegar and Hitch sat on
the curbstone, and took a seat beside them.</p>

<p>“Bless gracious, Marse Tom!” old Isaiah panted.
“I’s skeart plum’ outen my good sense!”</p>

<p>“What happened, Isaiah?” Gaitskill laughed.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” Isaiah answered, “dar’s a plum’
wild woman out in de Little Moccasin Swamp. She
throwed a gun at me de yuther day an’ run me
an’ Little Bit clear outen de hog-camp. Us rambled
back dis atternoon, an’ dat wild woman wus still dar&mdash;settin’
on de po’ch steps bangin’ on Little Bit’s
banjo an’ singin’ jes’ like a pig squeals when he gits
hung in de fence. When she seed me a comin’, she
riz up&mdash;she looked powerful mad to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Isaiah broke off and chuckled. Then he continued,
in solemn and convincing tones:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, I’ve saw a pig git mad an’ bust
outen de pen an’ fight an’ bite jes’ like a dog an’
run eve’y pig and nigger off de plantation. An’ I’ve
saw a cow git mad an’ kick over de bucket of milk an’
hook de feller whut milked her. An’ I’ve saw a man
git mad an’ cut up scand’lous an’ git tuck up an’
crammed in jail. An’ I’ve saw a woman git mad&mdash;plenty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
womans&mdash;but I ain’t never stayed an’ saw
whut dey done. Naw, suh, I skedaddles. Dat’s
how come me an’ Little Bit is here now. Dat wild
woman looked mad!”</p>

<p>There was a loud whoop up the street, and the
sound of galloping hoofs smote again upon the ears
of the little group in front of the court house. As
they turned to look a whole cavalry troop of horses
and mules swung into the main street and galloped
at full speed toward the court house square.</p>

<p>It was a perfect Mardi Gras procession.</p>

<p>One aged negro passed on a blind mule, holding a
baby in his lap, while two little pickaninnies rode
behind him&mdash;four on one animal. An immensely
fat woman rode by astraddle of a pacing donkey; she
balanced a bundle as large as herself on the neck of
her mount&mdash;food and household comforts of that
sort, wrapped up in a red bed-quilt.</p>

<p>A negro boy came by holding a sack whose contents
wriggled and whined, and the mustang he rode was
throwing fits&mdash;the sack contained four hound pups.
Another coon rode by holding in his free hand a
bucket of molasses; and strapped to his back, like a
knapsack was an immense bird-cage containing a
parrot, who clung desperately to his giddy perch and
squawked: “Look out! Look out! Look out!”</p>

<p>Thus, in grotesque procession, there passed before
the astonished eyes of Colonel Tom Gaitskill every
negro tenant and workman from the Nigger-heel
plantation&mdash;four hundred men, women, and children,
with his overseer, Mustard Prophet, in the
lead!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>“Thunderation!” Gaitskill bawled in a mighty
voice. “What’s the matter with you damnation
niggers?”</p>

<p>Mustard Prophet wheeled his mule and stopped
before Colonel Gaitskill.</p>

<p>The whole procession swung into a large open
space beside the court house, set apart for the use
of the country people as a hitching place for their
horses. All the business men in Tickfall promptly
shut up shop and assembled in front of the courthouse
to learn what all the fuss was about&mdash;and every
white man’s coat-pocket sagged down on one side
about four inches lower than it did on the other, and
he kept his hand in that pocket.</p>

<p>The negroes of Tickfall and the neighboring plantations
outnumbered the whites by ten thousand.</p>

<p>Having a natural respect and generally a true
friendship for the white people, following the peaceable
pursuits of agriculture, raising cotton, cotton,
and then more cotton; music-loving, laughter-loving,
care-free as children and inoffensive as a bird, the
negroes of Tickfall lived quietly with their white
neighbors and employers.</p>

<p>But any unusual movement among them always
awakened the white man’s suspicions and brought
him forth full-armed, grim as death, white-faced
and keen-eyed, to search the matter to the very
bottom.</p>

<p>A white man jostled against Dr. Sentelle.</p>

<p>The venerable preacher thrust his hand into the
tail-pocket of his clergyman’s coat and found himself
in possession of a heavy pistol. Colonel Gaitskill
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
backed quietly into the arms of a man standing
behind him and found both side pockets of his coat
weighted down with weapons.</p>

<p>Then Gaitskill stepped forward again and became
the spokesman, his voice cracking like a bull-whip
in the hands of a cowboy:</p>

<p>“What are you niggers doing in town?”</p>

<p>“Us comed to town to git away from de canned
bull, Marse Tom,” Mustard Prophet informed
him.</p>

<p>There was a barely audible “Ah!” from the
throats of the white men, who had held their breath
in intense desire to catch Mustard’s answer. The
anxiety of the white men was instantly relieved.
They did not understand, but if that crowd of men,
women, and children were scared and running away
from something, that put a much better light upon
the matter.</p>

<p>“To get away from&mdash;<i>what</i>?” Gaitskill snapped.</p>

<p>“Dunno, suh,” Mustard replied, scratching his
head. “I’s done heerd tell dat she eats ’em alive.”</p>

<p>“Eats&mdash;<i>what? who?</i>”</p>

<p>“Dey calls her de canned bull,” Mustard informed
him in uncertain tones.</p>

<p>“I presume he means <i>cannibal</i>,” Dr. Sentelle
suggested with a loud chuckle.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Mustard acquiesced. “Dat whut I
jes’ said.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about a <i>cannibal</i>?” Gaitskill
growled.</p>

<p>“Hopey, de woman whut cooks fer you, sont me
word, an’ old Isaiah an’ Little Bit fotch me de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
pertick’lers,” Mustard told him. “Ole Isaiah tole
me dat he done saw dat wild woman fight a bear an’
she kilt it dead. He specify dat she gib dat bear de
all-under holt an’ de fust two bites!”</p>

<p>“Isaiah is an old liar,” Gaitskill said.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. But I knowed you didn’t want me
to happen to no harm, so I hauled off an’ come to
town.”</p>

<p>“What did you bring all these other niggers for?”
Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p>“I didn’t fotch ’em wid me, Marse Tom,” Mustard
declared. “I tried to git ’em to stay back, but
sompein itched ’em right sudden to trabbel, an’ here
dey all am.”</p>

<p>There was a loud burst of laughter from the
white men, Gaitskill found his coat-pockets relieved
of their heavy guns, Dr. Sentelle lost the six-shooter
out of the tail of his Prince Albert coat, and the
business men went haw-hawing to their stores,
leaving Colonel Gaitskill and Dr. Sentelle to face
the rabble of panic-stricken negroes.</p>

<p>Gaitskill’s mind revolved a number of plans before
he found one to suit him. Finally he stood on the
court house steps and made oration:</p>

<p>“Hey, you niggers! Listen to me: Go to the
back door of my store and get your rations for the
night. All you nigger men be at the old cotton-shed
to-morrow morning by sunrise! Hear me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh!” a number of voices responded.</p>

<p>“Now, Mustard,” he said to his negro overseer,
“you get all these coons to the cotton-shed on time.
We want to get an early start!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>


<h3>VIII<br />

AT THE GAITSKILL HOG-CAMP</h3>

<p>The next morning fifty-five negroes mounted on
mules and horses waited at the cotton-shed for
Colonel Tom Gaitskill. Their only theme of conversation
was Diada.</p>

<p>“Revun Atts,” Mustard demanded of the pastor
of the Shoofly church, “when you got shet up wid
dat wild woman in de hawg-camp, why didn’t you
ax her ’fess religion?”</p>

<p>“I did make a riffle,” Vinegar Atts responded,
“but I couldn’t git my mouf set right fer preachin’
de Word.”</p>

<p>“He seen his duty but he done it not!” Hitch
Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t had no light on <i>how</i> to do it,” Vinegar said
defensively. “Excusin’ dat, I warn’t studyin’ how to
save by grace; I wus ponderin’ how to save my grease.”</p>

<p>The conversation ended by the arrival of Colonel
Gaitskill, dressed in a hunting suit and riding his
favorite black horse.</p>

<p>The negroes grouped their mounts close around
him to hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>“I want you niggers to ride out to the hog-camp
with me and help me bring Diada back to my house.
All this talk about Diada being a cannibal is a lie.
She ain’t a pretty nigger woman, but she’s just like
other black folks. She won’t hurt anybody. When
you find her, go right up to her, just like you would to
any other nigger woman. Hear me!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>“Yes, suh!” the voices answered.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” Hitch Diamond asked, “who’s
gwine lead dis here peerade?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“I’s powerful proud to hear dat, kunnel,” Hitch
declared. “An’ please, suh, kin I fotch up de rear
an’ keep dese niggers from laggin’ back?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you prefer that place.”</p>

<p>“Hitch needs he’p, kunnel,” Vinegar Atts declared
promptly. “I’ll fetch up behine wid Hitch.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Gaitskill agreed, stifling a desire to
laugh. “Of course, if Diada should attack us from
the rear&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Vinegar Atts interrupted him. “I’s
gwine fetch up de exack middle of dis here peerade.”</p>

<p>“Now, listen!” Gaitskill commanded in a loud
voice. “I don’t want Diada hurt in any way.
Don’t use any clubs or guns or knives. Catch her
with your hands. Come on, men!”</p>

<p>The posse pounded down the swamp road for
four miles, then started in single file along the narrow
bridle-path which led to the hog-camp three miles
distant in the center of the swamp.</p>

<p>From the moment they entered the swamp the
shouts and laughter of the negroes ceased.</p>

<p>They had all spent their lives within sight of that
jungle and knew well its fearful menace and entertained
toward it a most wholesome fear. They knew
that three deep, broad bayous flowed into it, widened
into an enormous mud-puddle and disappeared,
swallowed up by rank, encroaching vegetation.
They knew that the slow-moving, slimy water was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
breeding place for countless insects which stung and
bit and poisoned, and inhabited in pestilential swarms
the only open breathing spaces reserved amid the
vegetation, and they had seen cattle stagger out of
that swamp, their nostrils, throats, and ears filled
with tiny insects, fall to the ground in convulsions,
and die.</p>

<p>The ground around them was covered with vegetation,
so ropy with vines that a raccoon could not
penetrate it; the branches of the immense trees hung
downward, and were draped with long, ropelike
funereal streamers and festoons of Spanish moss, so
that it seemed that half the vegetable world was growing
from below upward and the other half was
growing from above downward, making a hot-house
purgatory, shut off from the sky above and the
earth below, and enclosing the men who rode that
narrow path like a trap.</p>

<p>The dim ridge which their horses trod was the
one route of ingress and egress through that obscure,
uncharted morass reeking with poison and choked
with a growth which seemed coeval with the dawn of
creation itself.</p>

<p>Gaitskill, noting the sudden silence of the negroes,
became uneasy. He knew that if the darkies were
thrown into a panic they would spur their mounts
into the jungle to hide, and that would be the end of
both the horse and his rider.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” old Isaiah said in a trembling tone,
“My hoss is a walkin’ lame.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill stopped and stood facing the long line of
frightened negroes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>“All you niggers pull to one side and let Isaiah
ride back to town!” he called.</p>

<p>“Who? Me?” Isaiah bawled. “Naw, <i>suh</i>! Dis
hoss ain’t so powerful lame&mdash;not as much as he wus
when I fust spoke. An’ even if his behine leg wus
twisted plum’ off, I’d shore make him hop along wid
you-alls.”</p>

<p>“Any of the rest of you niggers got lame horses?”
Gaitskill laughed.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, kunnel,” Hitch Diamond yelled, the
last man in the line. “My hoss is walkin’ so spry I
cain’t keep him behine by hisse’f. Lemme ride up
dar close to you!”</p>

<p>“Stay where you are, Hitch!” Gaitskill laughed.
“You asked me to let you ride behind. Come on,
men!”</p>

<p>The path widened and the horses struck into a
trot which brought them to the hog-camp in half an
hour.</p>

<p>Throughout the length and breadth of this swamp,
about a mile apart, there were curious mounds
rising ten or twelve feet above the surrounding
marsh. All these mounds were round in shape and
flat on the top.</p>

<p>Some of them were not more than a hundred feet
in diameter, while others were large, containing half
an acre of land. They had been built a hundred
years before by the Indians&mdash;and served a very
practical purpose. When the water flooded the
swamp in the autumn the wild animals took refuge
on these mounds. The Indians penetrated the
jungle in their canoes and visited each mound, easily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
slaying the deer and bears, and thus procuring their
winter supply of meat.</p>

<p>The Gaitskill hog-camp occupied the largest of
these mounds, the cabin standing in the center of a
two-acre plot. The flat top of the mound had
been kept cleared of timber, but the jungle encroached
to the very edge.</p>

<p>The posse galloped into this clearing, and Colonel
Gaitskill dismounted from his horse.</p>

<p>“You darkies stay here!” he commanded. “I’ll
see whether Diada is in the cabin.”</p>

<p>The cabin was empty. All of Isaiah’s smoked sausage
and hams had disappeared. Little Bit’s mandolin,
with the strings broken, lay in the corner of the
room, and a part of Mrs. Gaitskill’s silk kimono hung
from a splinter on the wall, showing how it had been
torn off. From a nail on the wall hung a long lasso.</p>

<p>Taking down the rope Gaitskill walked out again
to the negroes.</p>

<p>“She’s not here, men,” he announced. “We’ll
have to hunt her in the swamp.”</p>

<p>Adjusting the rope to his saddle-horn he mounted
and sat for a moment debating his next move.</p>

<p>Then Diada emerged from the jungle and stood
at the edge of the clearing, looking curiously at the
troop of men.</p>

<p>“Dar she!” the negroes howled.</p>

<p>Gaitskill rode slowly forward, holding out his
hand in a gesture of friendliness about as one would
approach to catch a horse. But Diada moved slowly
backward, keeping in the cleared space, always just
one leap distant from the jungle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>Twice they circled the clearing in this ridiculous
fashion, Gaitskill repeating in most wheedling and
coaxing tones every expression of fondness and
endearment with which he was acquainted.</p>

<p>“Dat chin-music ain’t gittin’ Marse Tom <i>nothin’</i>,”
Vinegar Atts declared, watching the elusive Diada.
“Me ’n’ Hitch’s done tried dat!”</p>

<p>Finally Gaitskill abandoned that plan, and quietly
loosened his rope and got ready to throw.</p>

<p>Riding back a few feet he gave the rope a quick
swing, and the noose settled prettily around the
arms of the giant woman just above her elbows.
There was not a trace of fear in her face, and she
moved slowly backward until the rope was taut.
To the interested negroes it looked like the simple,
peaceable game of “playing horse.”</p>

<p>Then Gaitskill spurred his horse to one side and
gave the rope a sharp jerk. Instantly a long-bladed
butcher-knife flashed in Diada’s hand, and the
severed rope trailed loosely upon the ground, while
the now harmless noose slipped down over her hands
and was lightly tossed aside.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Hitch Diamond exclaimed in tragic
tones. “Dat fish is done unbit an’ div!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill slowly drew in the rope and was busy
making another noose, when there was a warning
shout from the negroes.</p>

<p>Diada was coming across the clearing toward
Gaitskill, leaping like a deer. There was no trace
of anger in her manner, and no sign of danger except
the long-bladed knife in her powerful hand.</p>

<p>Gaitskill’s nervous horse shied at that monstrous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
woman with her fluttering, ragged garments, and
wheeled and bolted, snorting with terror.</p>

<p>The jungle kept the horse in the clearing as effectively
as a barbed-wire fence, but the animal had two
acres of level ground to run on and he proceeded to
cover that ground in record-breaking time. Gaitskill
might have quieted the animal very quickly,
except for the fact that this performance seemed to
please Diada, and she continued her pursuit, chasing
Colonel Gaitskill all around the lot.</p>

<p>“Look out, Marse Tom!” the negroes bawled,
amid whoops of laughter. “Don’t let her ketch
yer!”</p>

<p>The laughter of the negroes diverted Diada’s
attention to them.</p>

<p>With a loud “<i>Whoosh!</i>” she sailed into that compact
mass of men and horses, scattering them like a brick
dropped into a pile of feathers. Horses nickered
and plunged, mules squealed and kicked, and negroes
screamed with fright, and in a moment the cleared
space in front of the hog-camp was a circus-ring of
panicky men and beasts performing every imaginable
stunt, with Diada in the star rôle of circus-master
and chief of clowns.</p>

<p>Colonel Gaitskill’s horse found the path which led
back to Tickfall, plunged down the embankment,
and ran away with his helpless rider. The negroes,
seeing Gaitskill’s departure, followed at their swiftest
gait, their shrieks and wails of fright and woe rolling
through the swamp with hideous reverberations.</p>

<p>One mile from the hog-camp Gaitskill regained
control of his horse, and turned to ride back.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>Then he heard the thundering hoofs of the horses
and mules coming down the narrow bridle-path
toward him. The road was not wide enough to
pull aside and let them pass; even if it were, in
that moment of panic, the horses and mules might
become frightened at him and plunge into the
swamp.</p>

<p>Gaitskill regretted the necessity for his action,
but there was nothing else to do; he led that column
of wailing negroes in ignominious flight back toward
Tickfall.</p>

<p>He kept ahead of them until he reached the main
road, then turned aside and let them precede him.</p>

<p>As he sat watching that ludicrous procession of
squalling blacks, his own horse suddenly snorted and
bolted down the road at its wildest speed. Gaitskill
looked back to ascertain the cause of the animal’s
fright.</p>

<p>Lo, Diada was in full pursuit of the flying posse,
trotting with the speed of a galloping horse, her
tongue hanging out like a hot dog’s, Mrs. Gaitskill’s
kimono trailing behind her like a torn battle-flag,
her long, ugly-bladed knife clutched in her powerful
hand. One word came from her throat with the
explosive sound of a pistol-shot:</p>

<p>“<i>Whoo-ash!</i>”</p>

<p>There was no stopping his horse, so Gaitskill rode
the four miles back to Tickfall in something like
eight minutes. When he swung out of the swamp
road into the town he looked back again.</p>

<p>Diada was half a mile behind him, trotting tirelessly,
covering about ten feet of ground with each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
tremendous stride. Her farewell admonition came
to him across the distance.</p>

<p>Softened by the intervening space, it seemed to
contain a plaintive note of appeal; yet this impression
was but momentary, for Gaitskill found too close a
kinship between this outlandish expression and the
snarl of the wolf, the hiss of the snake, and the scream
of the jungle beast bent on blood and death.</p>


<h3>IX<br />

“DESE HERE IS TURR’BLE TIMES”</h3>

<p>Fifty-five terrified negroes galloped wildly into
Tickfall, distributed themselves in the various negro
settlements of the village, and told fifty-five separate
and distinct tales of horror about the fiasco at the
hog-camp.</p>

<p>One half truth ran through all the narratives,
holding them together as vari-colored beads are held
upon a string:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom Gaitskill bragged his brags at de
cotton-shed dat he wus gwine walk right up an’ put
his hand on dat wild woman. But he never done it
a-tall&mdash;naw, suh.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t git no nigher dat woman dan de eend
of a lassoo, an’ when she snuck up behine him wid
dat big butcher-knife in her han’, dat white man jes’
nachelly <i>’vaporated</i>! Yes, suh! Us niggers tried to
keep up an’ go along home wid him, but we ain’t
never got in sight of Marse Tom till yit&mdash;an’ us is
plum’ back in town! Dat nigger woman run at us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
jes’ like a wild hawg&mdash;you-all knows how de hawgs
pop dey jaws an’ says ‘<i>Whoosh</i>!’ When a wild hawg
does dat way, nigger, you better coon up a tree.
Well, suh, dat’s jes’ whut she said to us&mdash;<i>‘Whoosh</i>!’”</p>

<p>Thus the negroes walked from house to house
telling their appalling stories to little groups of pop-eyed
listeners, adding something more blood-curdling
to the tales with each repetition, until the terrified
inhabitants of Shiny, Shoofly, Hell’s Half-Acre,
and Dirty Six were as uneasy and fearful as if they
were standing in the crumbling crater of a rumbling
volcano.</p>

<p>Then the grapevine telephone was put into
operation.</p>

<p>There is nothing as mysterious to the white man
as the negro’s method of communicating information
for long distances and to the remotest cabins of his
race. “Word wus sont,” is the negro’s only explanation
of how he happened to know twenty minutes
after it occurred that a murder had been committed
in the woods twenty miles away.</p>

<p>Long before night the town began to fill up with
negroes coming in from plantations ten and twelve
miles away. They arrived unostentatiously, seeming
to spring up from the very sand of the street.
They seemed jumpy when they were spoken to,
moved about not singly but in groups, and kept
looking back over their shoulders.</p>

<p>The white people of the town noticed the anxiety
and strain, and it became a contagion. They knew
that a wild woman was at large, meditating they
knew not what outrage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>The sun set as red as blood, and in a few minutes
a heavy, smelly, yellow Gulf fog swept the town,
making objects invisible at a distance of twenty
feet, almost blotting out the little electric lights
which had just enough candle-power to reveal where
they were but not sufficient to show where anything
else was.</p>

<p>The Reverend Dr. Sentelle stumped his way down
to the post office upon his ponderous cane, mailed
a letter, and stood for a moment in the doorway
puffing a cigar. Several negroes passed, walking
down the middle of the street just as the venerable
preacher flicked his cigar-stump toward the gutter.
The butt whirled round and round and struck the
ground with a splash of fire from the lighted end.</p>

<p>What a howl!</p>

<p>The men ran down the street yelping like hound-dogs,
their feet pounding upon the sand, their voices
trailing off into less audible sounds of woe as they
continued their rapid flight.</p>

<p>Wondering at the unusual occurrence, Dr. Sentelle
felt his way back to his home through the thick fog,
and stood leaning upon his gate gazing up the street.</p>

<p>An object approached him, loomed up with
gigantic proportions through the fantastic exaggerations
of the fog, stopped a few feet from where the
preacher stood, and spoke one word in a thunderous
tone:</p>

<p>“Whoosh!”</p>

<p>Dr. Sentelle’s heavy walking stick went clattering
upon the ground, he reeled backward, struck his
heels against the porch steps, and sat down with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
violence which filled the dome of his cranium with
bursting, falling stars.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Diada stooped, picked up Dr. Sentelle’s stick by
the little end, and, thus armed with a weighty club,
she went loping onward.</p>

<p>A group of darkies sat in a negro barber-shop
discussing the wild woman of the woods. Diada
opened the door, entered as quietly and peaceably
as she could, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Whoosh!”</p>

<p>The negroes disappeared as promptly and as
completely as if that word were a cyclone puffing at a
handful of feathers.</p>

<p>Diada trotted down the street in the direction they
had gone and found herself in front of the Hen-Scratch
saloon, where a house full of patrons talked
in whispers and fortified themselves by indulgence
in red liquor. Diada entered the swinging door and
gave the pass-word: “Whoosh!”</p>

<p>The negroes whooshed. They went away from
that place in every direction, exhausting the treasuries
of their throats for sounds to vocalize their surprise
and terror.</p>

<p>Suddenly from every negro section of the town
there arose a wail which reverberated through the
village of Tickfall and brought every white man to
his feet white with fear:</p>

<p>“<i>Ah-ee!</i> <i>Ah-ee!</i> <i>Ah-ee!</i>”</p>

<p>Every white man seized his arms and ammunition
and started for the front door; then the thought of
his defenseless family stopped him, and held him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
there to patrol his yard and guard his own house
from the unknown peril which threatened.</p>

<p>Everywhere could be heard this wild call of fear.</p>

<p>Horses and mules broke out of their enclosures
and galloped wildly about the streets with a thunder
of pounding hoofs, calling to each other with frenzied
nickering. The cows began a ceaseless bawling,
and the excited dogs ran madly up and down the
premises of their masters, making a pandemonium
with their furious barking.</p>

<p>At intervals the noise lulled for a moment; then
invariably would be heard a wild scream, clear as
the outcry of a panther, ending with Diada’s one
word, divided now into two distinct syllables:</p>

<p>“<i>Whoo-ash!</i>”</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill leaned against the white
columns of his porch and listened to the weird sounds
which came to him from every quarter. In one
negro settlement the inhabitants were bawling a
song at the utmost capacity of their lungs, drowning
their fears with music.</p>

<p>In another settlement, with the regularity and
drumlike throb of a mighty chorus of immense
hammers pounding upon steel anvils, was heard the
cry: “Ah-ee! Ah-eel Ah-ee!”</p>

<p>From the section of the town occupied by the
whites could be heard the nickering and running of
horses, the bellowing of the cows, the barking of the
dogs, and now and then a fusillade of pistol shots.
While in the negro section closest to his home, Colonel
Gaitskill could hear the Rev. Vinegar Atts bellowing
like a bull of Bashan, praying in a voice which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
could be heard a mile, while those who knelt
with him backed him up in his stentorian implorations
with responses which echoed like a roll of
thunder:</p>

<p>“O Lawd, dese here is turr’ble times&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>(“Listen, Lawd, dat’s de trufe&mdash;turr’ble times&mdash;&mdash;”)</p>

<p>“De sun is done turned inter darkness an’ de
moon inter blood, an’ de drefful day of de Lawd am
come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>(“O-o-o Lawd, she sho’ am come&mdash;&mdash;”)</p>

<p>“We done saw de woman clothed wid de sun an’
de moon am under her foots&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>(“Ah-ee! Amen!”)</p>

<p>“Accawdin’ to Dy Word she done flied out to de
wilderness whar she done been nourished fer a time,
an’ half a time, an’ yuther times&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>(“Ah-ee! Double time&mdash;&mdash;”)</p>

<p>“Woe to de inhabiters of de yearth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>(“Whoa!”)</p>

<p>“O-o-o Lawd, fotch down thy angel to tote dis
nigger home&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Not a man or woman, white or black, closed an
eye in Tickfall that night.</p>

<p>The sheriff and a number of business men held
innumerable conversations over the telephone and
finally a company of them convened in the sheriff’s
office in the courthouse to confer about what should
be done to quell the panic. But conversations and
conferences came to naught because they were
afraid to go through the negro settlements in the
dense darkness lest some panic-stricken negro fire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
upon them from behind the door or beneath some
cabin.</p>

<p>At the first streak of dawn the negroes, with one
accord, moved toward the business part of the town
and assembled in a dense mass around the courthouse,
looking to the white people for protection.</p>

<p>Sheriff Flournoy made them a speech telling them
that the white people were their friends, that no
harm could come to them, that there was no cause
for uneasiness, and that he wanted them to stay
around the courthouse all day.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of his speech, Flournoy started
across the street to enter the Tickfall bank. There
was a wild yell from the negroes and a mighty scramble
among them to get around on the other side of the
courthouse.</p>

<p>Diada came out of an alley beside the Gaitskill
store and stood in the middle of the street. She was
holding Dr. Sentelle’s ponderous walking stick by
the small end like a club. She gazed, apparently
in wonder, at the crowd of negroes and whites.</p>

<p>As the silent mob viewed her with alarm, wondering
what outrage she would commit next, she caught
the big stick with a hand on either end, raised it high
above her head, and screamed:</p>

<p>“Whoosh! Whoo-ash! Whoosh!”</p>

<p>Flournoy drew his pistol and fired in the air above
her head three times.</p>

<p>Diada ducked at each shot, then she stood upright,
whirled the club around her head, and threw
it at the sheriff. The missile curved like an arrow
and went straight toward the mark. Flournoy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
avoided a crushed skull by falling flat upon the
ground and letting the club pass over him.</p>

<p>When he rose to his feet, Diada was trotting down
the road with the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>“Get your horses&mdash;everybody!” Flournoy shouted.</p>

<p>With that word of command began the greatest
man-hunt that Tickfall Parish had ever known.</p>


<h3>X<br />

THE MAN-HUNT</h3>

<p>Every man in Tickfall who had any sort of animal
to ride bestrode the beast and joined the procession,
which moved out of town in the wake of Diada.
Hundreds of negroes who had ridden in from the
plantations the night before galloped down the road
behind the whites. And every canine of any size
or color attached himself to the posse and went
plunging along with the men.</p>

<p>They came to a straight stretch of road where they
could see for over two miles. At the far end of that
stretch they beheld Diada, her head and shoulders
stooped far over, trotting with gigantic strides, traveling
with the tireless persistence of a desert camel.</p>

<p>To their surprise, Diada did not run into the
swamp, but continued upon the main road, which
led to the Tickfall landing on the Mississippi River.
Seeing this, the men did not attempt to run her
down, but remained content to keep her in sight.
At the end of an hour she was still trotting easily
with no signs of fatigue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>Finally Diada turned and ran into the forest.
With a mighty clamor the men raced after her,
floundering through the underbrush, and galloping
far over into the woods. When the posse had passed
out of sight among the trees, Diada quietly climbed
down from the branches of a big tree, where she had
concealed herself, and started down the road again.</p>

<p>The dogs discovered her first.</p>

<p>Yelping furiously they drove her from the main
road across the prairie marsh which skirted Lake
Basteneau, and penned her upon a narrow point
which projected like a peninsula into the lake and
was thickly overgrown with cypress saplings about as
large around as a man’s wrist.</p>

<p>The marsh between the road and the lake was too
soft for the men to venture on with their horses, and
it was even dangerous for a man to walk upon because
of the quicksands. But the men could look from the
road, across a part of the lake, and easily see Diada
and the dogs.</p>

<p>“Don’t go after her, men!” Flournoy called. “Let
the dogs run her away from there! We’ll get her
when she comes off that point!”</p>

<p>With the large butcher-knife which she had procured
from Mrs. Gaitskill’s kitchen she had begun to
cut down the cypress-saplings, trimming off the leaves
and the branches. She piled them up, dozens of
them, working swiftly.</p>

<p>The dogs did not advance to attack Diada. They
merely stood and barked at her. But they were in
possession of the only exit from the narrow point on
which Diada had been trapped.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>“Dat gal must be gittin’ ready to beat dem dogs
off wid dem poles,” Hitch Diamond remarked to
the other negroes. “She’s shore put a job up on
herse’f.”</p>

<p>But Diada had a surprise in store for them all.</p>

<p>Balancing one of the long saplings on the top of
her hand she hurled it like a javelin with the speed
and accuracy of an arrow. A hound-dog gave a yelp
which seemed to break in two in the middle&mdash;then he
died. The javelin had pinned him to the ground
like an entomologist’s specimen on a cardboard.</p>

<p>Then the javelins flew thick and fast into that
bunch of dogs, and every flying weapon found a
mark and brought forth a yelp of death. In a few
moments the dogs turned tail and came whining
back to their masters.</p>

<p>Diada snatched up a number of the javelins, ran
off the point of land, and trotted down the edge of
the lake toward the river.</p>

<p>“Leave your horses and follow her, men!” Flournoy
ordered.</p>

<p>Four hundred men sprang to the ground, spread
out in a long line like a fish-seine and went plunging
across the marsh in pursuit of the fleeing woman.
The grass was waist high, dead and dry as dust, but
it offered no places for concealment, and Diada’s tall
form was easily kept in sight.</p>

<p>At intervals the woman turned and hurled a javelin
at the posse, but they were careful to stay out of
danger.</p>

<p>In a little while the men noticed that Diada had
begun to show signs of exhaustion. She was traveling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
more slowly, stopping now and then to catch her
breath, and moving forward with a more pronounced
stoop to her mighty shoulders.</p>

<p>She had eaten nothing for two days, had had no
rest or sleep, and was now on the last lap of a twelve-mile
run at full-speed!</p>

<p>Finally she slowed down to a walk, and the walk
became a sort of stumble. She still carried a few of
her javelins, and it was evident that she was now
dependent upon them to keep her pursuers at a
distance, while both she and they realized that she
was now in the center of a prairie of marsh grass
where she could not supply herself with new weapons
when those she possessed were exhausted.</p>

<p>Something of the pathos of the situation dawned
upon the men, both white and black, and they became
silent, eyes strained toward the weakening,
staggering quarry, so soon to fall into their hands.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes the silence was unbroken except
for the swish of the marsh grass as the men
waded through it. Far across the prairie could be
seen the levee of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by the long,
dear, musical whistle of a boat upon the river.</p>

<p>Diada stopped. Again that long, clear whistle
came belling across the sun-scorched prairie.</p>

<p>Diada raised her hands straight up above her head
like a sun-worshiper, emitted a long, plaintive, howling
scream, which ended with that word which was
branded upon the memories of Tickfall forever:
“Whoosh! Whoo-ash!”</p>

<p>So dramatic was her action that the hair stood up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
on every man’s head, and a cold chill swept across
every sweat-drenched body.</p>

<p>The woman trotted slowly onward, moving now
in a straight line toward the river. She had nearly a
mile to travel to reach the levee, and she saw that
she could not make the distance before she was
captured.</p>

<p>Then she sprung another surprise&mdash;one which
came very near being the death of her pursuers.</p>

<p>Kneeling in the grass she picked up two tiny splinters
of bark and rubbed them rapidly together. A
small blue flame curled around her fingers and caught
in the dry marsh grass. Running to another point
she dropped the flame there.</p>

<p>Then a wild yell of horror swept across the prairie
and she beheld four hundred men in a panic, fleeing
for their lives.</p>

<p>Diada was safe from the fire because what little
breeze there was blew landward from the lake. In
an incredible time that prairie had become a furnace
of fire, the racing flames pursuing the screaming men,
making a scene resembling nothing so much as the
picture of that hell so vividly described “where the
smoke of torment ascendeth and there is weeping
and wailing and gnashing of teeth!”</p>

<p>The fire was checked when it reached the wide
sandy road which led to the Tickfall landing.</p>

<p>By the mercy of Heaven the men reached that
road unscorched by the flames! Mounting their
horses, they looked across the charred grass of the
prairie and beheld Diada trotting slowly onward
toward the Mississippi levee.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>With a wild shout they sent their steeds pounding
down the road after her.</p>

<p>Then around the bend of the river came a beautiful
sea-going yacht&mdash;an exquisite queen of the waters.
Her whistle emitted four long, clear signals for the
Tickfall landing.</p>

<p>“By George!” Colonel Gaitskill exclaimed, “that
is Captain Lemuel Manse’s yacht. My telegram
caught him at Vicksburg, and he turned around and
came back!”</p>

<p>In a moment the yacht came opposite to where
Diada stood upon the bank of the river. The watching
men saw her lift her hands high toward the
heavens. Then they heard a long, clear shout,
ending with the familiar: “Whoosh! Whoo-ash!”</p>

<p>The yacht answered with two short, sharp whistle
signals.</p>

<p>Diada ran swiftly down the levee, and then leaped
high and plunged far over into the muddy waters of
the Mississippi!</p>

<p>The wondering, watching men saw her head emerge
from the waves, saw her swim like a fish to the yacht,
saw her seize a rope which was tossed over the
side, and climb hand over hand to safety and
rest and peace and the care and protection of her
friends!</p>

<p>“That’s all, men!” Gaitskill said in a voice which
choked in his throat. “You may all go back home
now. Diada is gone from Tickfall forever!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>


<h3>XI<br />

“WHU ATCH”</h3>

<p>The yacht anchored in the middle of the river; a
skiff went to shore and brought Colonel Tom Gaitskill
and Sheriff Flournoy on board.</p>

<p>Sitting around a small table on the deck they told
Captain Lemuel Manse the story of Diada’s sojourn
in Tickfall.</p>

<p>Finally Gaitskill asked:</p>

<p>“Lem, what the devil did that wench mean by
hollering ‘Whoosh!’ at everybody?”</p>

<p>“She was not saying ‘Whoosh,’” Captain Manse
replied. “What she said was ‘<i>Whu atch!</i>’ That
was the first expression she used to me when the
cannibal chief brought her aboard the yacht.”</p>

<p>“Well, what does it mean?” Gaitskill persisted.</p>

<p>Captain Manse put his hand with a kindly gesture
upon his friend’s arm and told him.</p>

<p>Gaitskill’s fine face turned ashen, and he winced
as if a knife had pierced his heart.</p>

<p>The words mean:</p>

<p>“<i>Help! I am in trouble!</i>”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="Getting_Ready_to_Die">Getting Ready to Die</h2>


<p>Sheriff John Flournoy loafed in the office of
the Tickfall <i>Whoop</i>, and listened to the bark and
splutter of a little one-dog-power engine attached to
the printing press. The air was permeated with the
odor of gasoline, machine oil, and printers’ ink. The
cigar he was attempting to smoke tasted of all three,
and he tossed it out of the window.</p>

<p>“Just before Christmas is the worst time of the
year,” he sighed impatiently. “Everybody tries to
be so blame cheerful and good-natured.”</p>

<p>He turned around in his screaking swivel-chair and
glared at the typewriter on the table before him.
He reached out an idle finger and touched a key;
there was an immediate response in the sharp tap
of the type upon the platen.</p>

<p>“I never did fiddle with one of these things,” he
grinned to himself, as he picked up a sheet of paper
and adjusted it in the machine. “But I’m never
too old to learn.”</p>

<p>Then, with the ponderous middle finger of each
giant hand, the big sheriff began to poke out letters
which spelled words&mdash;sometimes. Tiny beads of
sweat came out on his forehead; his iron jaws clamped;
his lips tightened; and a strained look came into his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
eyes, accentuating the tiny wrinkles which formed
crows’-feet on each side of his temples.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” he complained. “I never worked as
hard in my whole life. Why in thunder don’t they
arrange these letters alphabetically, instead of
scrambling them all over the ranch so a feller can’t
find them?”</p>

<p>After a long time he leaned back with a sigh of
infinite relief and snatched the paper from the
machine. A broad grin spread over his face at the
sight of his handiwork.</p>

<p>“This is a fearful and wonderful thing,” he chuckled.
“I didn’t know there were as many figures,
punctuation marks, and capital letters in the world as
I have interspersed gratuitously in this interesting
communication.”</p>

<p>The bark and splutter of the gasoline engine
suddenly ceased. Flournoy sprang up and opened
the door of the office entering into the press-room.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he demanded. “Broke
down?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” the one lone printer informed him. “I’m
finished.”</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t!” Flournoy informed him. “Come
in here a minute!”</p>

<p>Wonderingly, the printer entered the office.
Flournoy handed him the sheet of paper on which he
had been writing.</p>

<p>“How much space will that take in your paper?”
the sheriff asked.</p>

<p>The printer finished reading, broke into a loud
laugh, and answered:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>“About two sticks.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Flournoy grinned. “You set that
up, take some article of the same length out of
your paper, and put mine in its place. Then run
me off three copies.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the printer entered the office
with three damp copies of the Tickfall <i>Whoop</i> and
pointed to the contribution which Flournoy had
furnished.</p>

<p>“These three papers are all you ran off?” the
sheriff asked.</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“All right. You understand this piece of news is
not for general circulation.”</p>

<p>Folding and pocketing the three copies, Flournoy
walked slowly back toward his office in the courthouse.</p>

<p>Sitting on a stone step in front of the court house,
trusting the December sun to limber up his rheumatic
muscles, was old Isaiah Gaitskill. Motionless as a
stone idol, his battered wool hat in his clawlike hand,
toothless, his face wrinkled like the withered hull of a
walnut, his snow-white wool fitting his head like a
rubber cap, he made a characteristic picture of the
South.</p>

<p>“Have you seen a copy of the Tickfall <i>Whoop</i> this
morning, Isaiah?” Flournoy asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. I lef’ my specks to home, an’ so I
didn’t git no paper,” Isaiah answered easily.</p>

<p>“Here’s one of ’em,” Flournoy grinned, taking it
from his pocket. “You better look it over&mdash;there’s
something about you in it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>“How’s dat, boss?” Isaiah asked quickly. “Who
knowed my name so good dat he writ’ me in de
paper?”</p>

<p>“Your name isn’t mentioned,” Flournoy smiled.
“It just speaks of the colored folks in general. Shall
I read the article to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, ef you please, suh,” Isaiah answered
eagerly. “I hadn’t oughter lef’ my readin’ specks at
de hawg-camp. My Lawd, how come all de niggers
got spoke about in de white folks’ paper?”</p>

<p>Flournoy impressively opened the sheet, adjusted
his eye-glasses with dignity, frowned portentously,
knowing well that the negro was watching every
move. Having thus impressed Isaiah with the importance
of the article, Flournoy read aloud what he
had written a few minutes before:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="caption">DANGER! DANGER!</p>

<p class="caption">ALL THE NEGROES IN TICKFALL ABOUT
TO DIE!</p>

<p>A mysterious disease has broken out
among the negroes in Tickfall, resulting
in a number of sudden deaths. The doctors
of the town declare there is no cure.
The parish health-officer, Dr. Moseley,
pronounces the disease to be “ancestors,”
and declares that all the negroes have
them&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a lot more of the same sort, and it was
read aloud by Sheriff Flournoy with due impressiveness,
and with the design of striking terror into the
hearts of the negroes of Tickfall. When he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
finished reading, this incorrigible practical joker
asked seriously:</p>

<p>“Would you like to have a copy of this paper,
Isaiah?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, boss! Gimme two copies!” Isaiah exclaimed
as he sprang to his feet. “I’s gwine down
an’ tell de niggers somepin dey don’t know!”</p>

<p>Snatching the papers from the sheriff, old Isaiah
started toward Dirty-Six with surprising speed for a
man of his age and feebleness. The first person he
met was the Rev. Vinegar Atts.</p>

<p>“How come all dis bust of speed, Isaiah?” the fat
preacher grumbled. “Whut’s itchin’ on you to
trabbel so peart?”</p>

<p>Isaiah thrust the paper into the hands of Vinegar
Atts.</p>

<p>“Read!” he chattered. “Read dat paper an’ git
ready to die!”</p>

<p>The fat, pot-bellied, squat-legged preacher spraddled
his feet in the middle of the road like a Colossus
and began to read. Suddenly his hand trembled,
his feet began to shuffle in the sand, and he breathed
heavily and audibly, like an asthmatic donkey.
When he had finished, his hands dropped inertly to
his sides, and with wide-open mouth, he sucked in a
breath which threatened to consume all the air in
Tickfall.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” he bawled. “Isaiah, I tell you de
honest truth&mdash;I ain’t fitten to die. I ain’t made no
kind of arrangements to die!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Isaiah agreed mournfully. “Dis
here terr’ble news is done kotch me up short, too!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>“Lemme sot down!” Vinegar panted, as he walked
to the curb and sat down with his feet in the gutter.</p>

<p>The paper shook in his trembling hand, and Vinegar
glared at it with horror-stricken eyes. One imagines
that a condemned criminal would gaze at a cup
of poison with such a look. The man’s thick lips
turned ashen, and when he snatched off his hat his
scalp had become furrowed with little ridges.</p>

<p>To one unfamiliar with the negro character, it is
almost incredible how much importance the members
of that race attach to the printed word. Since that
time, over half a century ago, when every negro
received a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation
and by the magic of print found himself free from
bondage, it has never occurred to one of them to
question the veracity of any article in book, magazine,
or newspaper. Printed words have the potency of
words of Holy Writ.</p>

<p>“O Lawdy!” Atts bawled. “Ain’t dis awful?
My gosh, I never had no notion befo’ whut a mean,
wuthless, onery nigger I is! Isaiah, I’s a <i>bad</i> nigger.
Nobody don’t soupspicion how bad I is!”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows!” Isaiah remarked gloomily.</p>

<p>“Yes, brudder,” Vinegar whined, gasping for air.
“Dat is whut is troublin’ my mind right now!”</p>

<p>“Sheriff John Flournoy gimme two papers,”
Isaiah said. “I cain’t read nothin’. I’s gwine leave
’em wid you. I’s moseyin’ back to de hawg-camp
to git ready to die!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Isaiah,” Vinegar mourned. “Dat
is all whut is lef’ fer us po’ niggers to do. Less all
start to git ready to prepare to die!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>A few minutes later Vinegar Atts entered the Hen-Scratch
saloon, dragged his lead-weighted feet over
the sand-covered floor, and fumblingly spread out a
copy of the paper upon the table before the eyes of
Skeeter Butts, Hitch Diamond, and Figger Bush.</p>

<p>“Read dat, niggers!” he bellowed in awe-stricken
tones. “Read an’ prepare fer de end!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts started to read the article aloud,
but long before he had finished his voice was trembling
until he could hardly enunciate the awful words.
He stopped, placed his quivering hands over his face,
tried to rub the stiffness out of the muscles of his
lips and cheeks, and sighed:</p>

<p>“You finish it fer us, Revun! Dis is awful!”</p>

<p>When Vinegar Atts concluded, the three negroes
groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“Whar did you git dat paper, Revun?” Hitch
Diamond inquired, his giant form shaking with the
palsy.</p>

<p>“Isaiah got it from Sheriff Flournoy,” Atts
replied.</p>

<p>“Ef Sheriff Flournoy an’ Dr. Moseley is tuck it
up, dar ain’t no hopes fer us,” Skeeter Butts lamented.
“Dem white mens do bizzness wid niggers
’thout no pity. De pest-wagon is comin’ fer
us all!”</p>

<p>Into each mind came the instant recollection of that
dreadful time, thirty years before, when the yellow-fever
had invaded Tickfall, leaving barely enough of
the living to bury the dead; when two-wheeled carts
had rumbled through the negro settlements of Tickfall
at midnight, and the cart-driver had bellowed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
through a cloth saturated with carbolic acid and
wrapped around his mouth: “Bring out your
corpse!”</p>

<p>“Whu-whu-whut is ancestors?” Hitch Diamond
stammered, glaring at the newspaper. “Whut kind
of new ailment is dat?”</p>

<p>“De paper don’t say,” Skeeter Butts declared
tremblingly. “But I figger it’s some kind of new
worm or bug. All de niggers has ’em.”</p>

<p>“I wonder ef dat’s how come I feels so bad?”
Figger Bush asked fearfully, pulling at his little
shoebrush mustache. “I thought I needed a
drink or somepin, but dis writin’ says it’s a epizootic!”</p>

<p>“No mo’ drinks fer you, Figger,” Vinegar Atts
rumbled. “Ef you figger on havin’ any shore hopes
of heaven, you better cut it out!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;I swears off now!” Figger stuttered, looking
at Atts with eyes which nearly popped out of his
head.</p>

<p>“All us niggers better refawm,” Hitch Diamond
declared. “I don’t b’lieve prize-fightin’ is a fitten
occupation fer a nigger about to die!”</p>

<p>“Sellin’ booze shorely ain’t a heavenly job,”
Skeeter said sadly. “I never thought ’bout dat
befo’.”</p>

<p>“Preachin’ don’t he’p a nigger be as good as I
wish it would,” Rev. Vinegar Atts lamented. “I’s
a real mean nigger myse’f!”</p>

<p>“Ef all de niggers in Tickfall dies, whut’ll de white
folks do fer wuck-hands?” Figger Bush asked.</p>

<p>“Huh,” Hitch Diamond grunted. “No white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
man wouldn’t miss you! You ain’t did a day’s
wuck sense you wus bawned.”</p>

<p>“I wus bawned tired,” Figger said defensively.
“I’s jes’ nachelly one of dese set-easy niggers!”</p>

<p>“You better git a hustle on you in yo’ las days,”
Skeeter informed him. “De good Lawd ain’t got
no use fer lazy folks.”</p>

<p>“Us better all git gooder dan we is,” Vinegar Atts
said positively. “I been tellin’ dese Tickfall niggers
eve’y Sunday ’bout deir devilmint, but ’tain’t done
’em no good. Now it’s plum’ too late!”</p>

<p>“Naw, Revun, ’tain’t too late,” Skeeter Butts said
earnestly. “I b’lieve us’ll all listen to religium
advices right now. Don’t gib us up&mdash;keep on
tryin’!”</p>

<p>“Would you wish to he’p me refawm dese niggers?”
Atts asked.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter said eagerly. “Ef dey don’t
refawm, I’ll shoot daylights through ’em&mdash;I&mdash;I mean
I’ll be powerful sorry for ’em.”</p>

<p>Skeeter took a big breath, sighed audibly, and wiped
the cold sweat from his temples.</p>

<p>“Will you he’p in dis refawm, Hitch?” Vinegar
inquired.</p>

<p>“Shore will!” Hitch informed him. “I’ll begin
on de fust nigger you p’ints out to me. Jes’ one
religium roun’ will be all Hitchie wants&mdash;I’s de real
K. O. con of dis town.”</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t de right kind of talk to use, Hitch,”
Vinegar said reprovingly. “You better learn some
church-word talk befo’ you starts out on dis refawm.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>“Dem niggers will git my drift,” Hitch declared
with conviction.</p>

<p>“Whut refawms is we gwine start?” Skeeter Butts
asked.</p>

<p>“Lawd,” Figger Bush squeaked. “It’s a endless
job&mdash;look at me for ninstunce!”</p>

<p>“Whut is yo’ mos’ upsettin’ sin, Figger?” Vinegar
asked.</p>

<p>Figger meditated for a long time. Then he said:</p>

<p>“So many sins is done got me down dat I don’t
rickolect which one fust upset me, Revun.”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t waste no time on Figger!” Skeeter
Butts said disgustedly. “He’s a hopeless job!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say dat, Skeeter!” Figger pleaded. “You
know you is done led me inter all de devilmint I ever
done!”</p>

<p>Skeeter gasped like a landed fish.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it de truth!” he mourned. “You ain’t
never had sense enough to be bad by yo’se’f! I shore
is made a bad impression on you, Figger&mdash;I’s awful
sorry!”</p>

<p>“Less pass some rules ’bout dis refawm!” Hitch
Diamond proposed. “We’ll bunch all de sins
togedder an’ tell de niggers to quit ’em all!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de idear!” Vinegar agreed. “Git me a
pencil an’ a piece of write-on paper!”</p>

<p>Perfervid advocates of temperance and total
abstinence violently proclaim without fear of successful
contradiction that in the haunts of the demon rum
are hatched out all the iniquitous schemes for the
destruction of the morals of the people. Nevertheless,
this is the record of the most extensive reform
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
ever achieved in any community in the United
States, and it was born in the Hen-Scratch saloon,
in a negro settlement called Dirty-Six, in Tickfall,
Louisiana, on a certain day in December.</p>

<p>For two hours the four negroes sweated and
fumed, consuming cigarettes, and devising their
code of morals. At last Vinegar Atts laid the sheet
of paper on the table and they surveyed the result:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No lofen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No quorlen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No kussen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No drams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gamblen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No steelen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“My Lawd!” Figger Bush sighed. “Dat takes
away all my employments. Ef a nigger cain’t do
none of dem things he mought as well be dead!”</p>

<p>“You’se gwine be soon enough, Figger,” Vinegar
Atts reminded him in mournful tones. “Don’t go
shovin’ up dat happenstance by wishin’ fer it!”</p>

<p>“‘No fites,’” Hitch Diamond read. “Dat puts
me outen bizziness.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no job,” Skeeter mourned, looking at
the paper. “‘No drams, no gamblen.’”</p>

<p>“‘No lofen,’” Vinegar Atts lamented. “I’s a
powerful fat nigger to git active right sudden, at my
age.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Atts sprang to his feet and howled:</p>

<p>“Hol’ on, niggers&mdash;us needs anodder rule! I adds,
‘No cuttin’ out church!’”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>“’Tain’t necessary,” Hitch snickered. “You
cain’t keep de niggers outen chu’ch when terr’ble
times comes!”</p>

<p>“I guess us better git out an’ succulate dis repote,
niggers,” Vinegar said when he received this assurance.
“Us ain’t got any too much time. De Shoofly
chu’ch-bell rings to-night at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>The grapevine telephone was promptly put into
operation, and in twenty minutes every negro in
Tickfall knew that a dreadful and mysterious malady
was rife among them, and that death waited just
around the corner with a sharp butcher-knife in his
hand.</p>

<p>Laughter died in the throats of the most laughter-loving
people in the world; the thrumming of the
banjo ceased in the cabin; the chatter of care-free
women and the shouts of happy pickaninnies sank
away into silence; easy-smiling lips took on a pout
of distress, and eyes which usually glowed with
humor looked into the mystery and the dark of the
unknown and were strained and fear-stricken.</p>

<p>Like old hens going to roost, the women began to
assemble in the large, barnlike Shoofly church long
before dark. The town began to fill up with negroes
from the plantations and the swamps, and from
every negro settlement in Tickfall, the feet of the
negroes made straight paths toward the Shoofly
church. The ringing of the church-bell was a signal
for the belated to hasten, and the building was
packed with people when Vinegar Atts rose and
started a hymn. It was an old, familiar tune to
them all, and for a moment the great volume of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
sound rolled out of the house and thundered into the
ears of all the white inhabitants of the town. But as
the congregation began to consider the meaning of
the words they sang, they appeared ominous with
warning and threat, and gradually the voices died
away:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some folks do not believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dat a whale could Joner receive;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But dat don’t make my tale at all untrue!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dar is whales on eve’y side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wid deir mouths opened wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An’ you better look out or one will swaller you!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then Vinegar Atts announced:</p>

<p>“Mr. Muskeeter Butts will specify de puppus of
dis meetin’!”</p>

<p>Skeeter arose, clawed at his high, white collar so
that he could speak without strangling to death,
adjusted his enormous cuffs so that he could hold the
newspaper, and began in a trembling, squeaky voice:</p>

<p>“Marse John Flournoy gib dis here newspaper to
Isaiah Gaitskill. Brudder Isaiah gib it to Revun
Vinegar Atts. I reads a piece offen dis here front
page.”</p>

<p>As Skeeter read, the negroes joined in with a wailing
lamentation, which as the fearful news sank into
their consciousness became thunderous.</p>

<p>“‘Danger! Danger!’” Skeeter read. “‘All de
niggers in Tickfall about to die!’”</p>

<p>(“O Lawd, hab mussy! Dig my grave wid a silber
spoon!”)</p>

<p>“‘A mysterious disease has broken out among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
negroes in Tickfall, result-in’ in a num-ber of sud-den
death&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>(“Ah-ee. O he’p us! Gwine to die!”)</p>

<p>“‘De dorctors of de town de-clare dar is no
cure&mdash;’”</p>

<p>(“Jes’ plum’ ’bleeged an’ bound to die!”)</p>

<p>All night long the negroes remained packed in the
Shoofly church, actually too scared to go home in
the dark. Song after song rolled like thunder from
the building, a pathetic effort to drown their fears
with music. Never had Vinegar Atts been as earnest
in his prayers and exhortations, nor had the people
of his parish ever before shown such earnestness in
their responses. Every man and woman in the
church professed religion that night. Never was a
reform as instantaneous and as complete.</p>

<p>Along toward day the negroes began to rid themselves
of their weapons of sin. Figger Bush came to
the front of the congregation with the “jerks” and
tremblingly laid upon the top of the table a cheap
pistol, a pair of brass knucks, and a deck of greasy,
soiled playing cards. His example was contagious,
and in a few minutes the table was loaded with cards,
whisky bottles, dice, brass knucks, daggers, razors,
rabbit feet, and hoodoo-charms of all sorts.</p>

<p>“Cornfess yo’ sins!” Vinegar Atts bellowed.
“Cornfess up!”</p>

<p>Negroes sprang up all over the house and bawled
their iniquities into the ears of the people, but each
negro was too intent on thinking of his own transgression
to listen to the vices of his fellow, who spoke
as a dying man to dying men!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>When the rising sun dissolved the last lurking
shadow, the all-night revival came to an end in this
manner:</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond arose, holding in his hand the
sheet of paper which contained the rules of reform
devised in the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>“I motions befo’ we turns out dat all of us promise
to keep de rules wroted down on dis paper!” he
bellowed.</p>

<p>After he had read the list the congregation unanimously
adopted this new code of conduct and dispersed.
The people walked home in groups, looking
fearfully behind them at intervals, lifting their feet
high like turkeys walking through mud, ready at an
instant for precipitate flight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sudden reform among the negroes of Tickfall
caused a sensation among the white people of the
village.</p>

<p>As a general thing, a white man was accustomed
to spending four days hunting for a negro willing to
do half a day’s work; he secured promises from ten
darkies to “be dar early in de mawnin’.” Then he
waited ten days, and went out and did the work
himself.</p>

<p>But by nine o’clock on this day, the Tickfall bank
was crowded with negroes who wished to see Marse
Tom Gaitskill about getting a job. Every merchant
in the town was beset by applications for labor.
Darkies walked from house to house, seeking employment,
and every chance pedestrian upon the
street was accosted with a greeting which after a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
while almost shattered the nerves of the white
inhabitants of the village:</p>

<p>“Got any wuck fer a strong, willin’ nigger, boss?”</p>

<p>Of course the negroes spoke not a word which
would reveal the reason for this sudden increase in
industry, and the white people could only observe
the amazing results and wonder.</p>

<p>Nearly every lawn in Tickfall held a boy busy with
tools, cutting the grass, raking the dead leaves, hoeing
out the flower-beds, and mending the fences.
White people accustomed to seeing a workman take
ten minutes to chop down one weed, and half an
hour to light his corn-cob pipe, now observed that
all were working with feverish haste, and at the same
time with the most minute care and exactness as if it
were a religious observance of some sort.</p>

<p>“What ails all these coons in town?” Gaitskill
laughed as he looked down the street and saw not a
single dusky loafer.</p>

<p>“Christmas is coming!” Flournoy laughed. “Day
after to-morrow is Christmas. Had you forgotten?”</p>

<p>“They must expect to draw a prize-package from
the white Santa Clauses this year,” Gaitskill grinned.
“Heretofore they’ve been jest as lazy before as
after.”</p>

<p>At that moment Hitch Diamond came around the
corner and stopped in front of the Gaitskill store.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” he said earnestly. “How much
do a barrel of lime cost?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” Gaitskill said. “Want to whitewash
something?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; dat is, some yuther niggers do. Us is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
got a notion to waste a lot of whitewash on our fences
an’ cabins.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give the niggers all the lime they need,”
Gaitskill said promptly. “Tell ’em to come to this
store and get it free!”</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond turned and walked hastily down
the street. In the next half hour he paid a call at
every cabin in all the negro settlements of Tickfall.
He pounded on each cabin door with his iron fist,
and when the door was opened he entered and looked
around.</p>

<p>“How many niggers lives in dis cabin?” he asked.
“How many of dat gang is got ’um a job?”</p>

<p>When he found a negro who had no employment,
he swept down upon him with all the righteous fury
of a prophet of old.</p>

<p>“Whut ails you, nigger? Don’t you know you’s
gwine to die? Git ready! Git ready! Go to
Marse Tom Gaitskill’s sto’ an’ tell dem white men to
gib you a bucket of lime an’ a white-wash brush.
Den you white dis cabin, inside an’ out, an’ put
whut’s lef’ on dis ole rickety, busted-down fence!
Fix de fence up, too!”</p>

<p>At noon, when Gaitskill passed his store on the
way to lunch, a clerk ran out and said:</p>

<p>“Colonel, do you really mean for us to give all that
lime away? The niggers have carried away forty
barrels of whitewash in the last two hours!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill emitted a sharp whistle of surprise. He
scratched his head a moment, then grinned:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Frank. Let ’em have it. Christmas
is coming!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>Rev. Vinegar Atts found himself overwhelmed
with work. The sudden change in the moral life of
his parishioners made a demand upon his services
every moment of that busy day. Sick people, who
could not come to the church, sent for him to come to
see them. Prayer-meetings were held in many of the
cabins. A constant stream of people moved in and
out of the Shoofly church, and their singing and
shouting could be heard for a mile.</p>

<p>“Git ready to die! Git ready to die!” Vinegar
bawled from house to house. “De ancestors will git
you ef you don’t watch out!”</p>

<p>Under Hitch Diamond’s direction, all the negro
settlements were being whitewashed. Under Vinegar
Atts’s admonition the cabins were swept out, the
yards were cleaned, the cabins were aired, and every
scrap of paper and every particle of trash was gathered
up and burned. These were not original ideas with
the negroes. They had been taught this in the fever
epidemic, when a government health officer had had
charge of the sanitary work of the village.</p>

<p>The village began to fill up with strange darkies
who had come in from the plantations and the
swamp.</p>

<p>“Whut you coons doin’ here?” Vinegar Atts
demanded of a bunch of them.</p>

<p>“Us come in whar de dorctors kin git to us easy,”
one of them answered nervously. “Word wus sont
dat all de niggers is about to die!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Vinegar bellowed. “But whut
sort of sight will you coons be when you is dead&mdash;mud
all over yo’ britches an’ no socks on? Git busy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
and clean up! Go down to de bayou an’ take a wash&mdash;buy
you a clean shu’t an’ some socks&mdash;git ready to
die!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts sat alone in the Hen-Scratch saloon.
He was the only idler in Tickfall, a compulsory idler,
for the reform had put him out of business. The
sound of the fiddle and the banjo was heard no more.
Laughter and shouting had ceased. Not a negro entered
his barroom, and most of his regular customers
passed on the other side of the street. Skeeter sat in
front of his saloon all day in mournful and fearful
loneliness.</p>

<p>Then, just at dark, he had the surprise of his life.</p>

<p>Three men came up the street and stopped, talked
for a moment in low tones, then entered the saloon
on tiptoe and came to where Skeeter was sitting
behind the bar.</p>

<p>“Us is a cormittee to wait on you, Skeeter,”
Vinegar Atts said in funereal tones.</p>

<p>“Whut is I done?” Skeeter asked in a frightened
voice.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t whut you done; it’s whut you ain’t
done,” Vinegar informed him. “You done showed
yo’se’f de one sinner in Tickfall.”</p>

<p>“How come?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts produced the paper on which he had
written the “Rules of Reform” in that very room
the day before. He handed the paper to Skeeter.</p>

<p>“Whut do de fust rule say, Skeeter?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“‘No lofen,’” Skeeter read tremblingly.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts placed a heavy hand upon the shoulder
of the barkeeper and bawled:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>“What is you done fer a livin’ to-day, nigger?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” Skeeter stammered. “I&mdash;it ’pears
like you-all is done put me outside of a job. I ain’t
had no customers to-day.”</p>

<p>“You been loafin’,” Hitch Diamond proclaimed in
a pugnacious voice. “How does you especk to git
to heaven when you die? Don’t you know de
ancestors will get you befo’ mawnin’?”</p>

<p>“Less don’t gib de ancestors no show at him,”
Figger Bush squealed. Figger was covered with
whitewash, had done his first day’s work for years,
and was feeling righteous. “Less hang him to a tree
an’ larn him a lesson!”</p>

<p>“Hol’ on, fellers!” Skeeter begged earnestly. “I
didn’t ketch on ’bout dis rule. I figgered dat a nigger
whut had a job oughter stay on it. De Tickfall
niggers all j’ined de refawm, but I thought I oughter
stay on my job so I could sell booze to de coons from
de swamp an’ de plantations. But none of ’em
didn’t buy!”</p>

<p>“You git outen dis sinful saloon an’ go to wuck,”
Hitch howled, shaking his hamlike fist under Skeeter’s
nose, “or I’ll bust yo’ fool neck!”</p>

<p>“Yo’ intentions is good, Hitch,” Vinegar Atts said
reprovingly; “but you is done busted rule two whut
says ‘no quorlin’,’ an’ you mighty nigh fractioned
rule number three whut specifies ‘no fightin’!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;uh&mdash;Skeeter knows I ain’t mean no harm,”
Hitch murmured painfully. “I jes’ said dat because
I loves him. I’d druther bust his neck dan not hab
him foller along atter us when us goes to heaben.”</p>

<p>“I’ll git good,” Skeeter said meekly. “I’ll see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Marse John Flournoy as soon as it’s good daylight
to-morrer.”</p>

<p>“Better not pesticate Marse John, Skeeter,”
Figger Bush advised him. “He tole me dat de nex’
nigger whut axed him fer a job wus flirtin’ wid a
hearse!”</p>

<p>“Whut kin I do?” Skeeter lamented. “Dar uster
be mo’ free jobs dan willin’ niggers; now dar’s mo’
niggers dan jobs.”</p>

<p>“Ef you cain’t wuck fer somebody else, wuck, for
yo’se’f,” Vinegar Atts advised him. “Git a scrub-brush
an’ slop-bucket an’ scour out dis here saloom.
Git a sack of lime an’ whitewash it! Dis house
belongs to Sheriff Flournoy, an’ he’ll remember you
kind when you is goned hencefo’th an’ ain’t never
no mo’!”</p>

<p>“I’ll shore do it!” Skeeter assured them.</p>

<p>Having accomplished their mission, the committee
then sat down and became sociable over Skeeter’s
cigarettes. When they had smoked for a while
Skeeter suddenly asked:</p>

<p>“Revun Atts, whut is de lates’ news from de
epizootic?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t heerd nothin’,” Atts replied. “Of co’se,
I ain’t gwine aroun’ beggin’ fer de pest-wagon by axin’
de white folks no fool questions!”</p>

<p>“Whut do de papers say?” Skeeter persisted.</p>

<p>“Dunno.”</p>

<p>“I bet you some of dem papers is got a heap mo’
in ’em ’bout de disease dan de papers us niggers got
to read,” Figger Bush proclaimed.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Vinegar Atts exclaimed. “I never thunk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
of dat! Of co’se, de white folks ain’t gwine print
all de news fer a nigger.”</p>

<p>“Dey don’t divide up nothin’ else even,” Hitch
Diamond said. “I motions dat Skeeter Butts be
’p’inted a cormittee to visit all de white folks’ houses
an’ colleck up deir old Tickfall <i>Whoopses</i> so us kin git
de lates’ news.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” Skeeter said uneasily; “but I ain’t
gwine tell ’em whut I wants wid de papers. I’ll
specify dat I wants ’em to cover some shelves in de
Hen-Scratch.”</p>

<p>“Start soon in de mawnin’, Skeeter,” Atts admonished
him. “We’ll meet you here at dinner-time
an’ read up&mdash;mebbe all de niggers on de plantations
is dead an’ us don’t know it. I’s seed a
whole passel of buzzards sailin’ aroun’ to-day!”</p>

<p>The committee moved on, visiting from house to
house, admonishing each occupant who had not
observed all the rules of reform, just as the white men
had done years before during the fever epidemic.</p>

<p>Then a totally unexpected thing happened.</p>

<p>The next day being Christmas Eve, every negro in
Tickfall lost his job at noon. All business places
were closed, and every man went home to get a good
start for the Christmas celebration. Several hundred
negroes found themselves with a half-day of idleness
confronting them. They cut all the weeds on the
streets in all the negro settlements, burned all the
trash, put four coats of whitewash on the Shoofly
church, mended all the fences, tore down several
unsightly shacks which had been decaying in the
sun for half a century, dug ditches to drain their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
communities, and ceased their work at dark to get
supper and assemble in their church, where Vinegar
Atts later confronted more work-weary parishioners
then he had ever seen before.</p>

<p>In the midst of their evening service Skeeter Butts
arrived, carrying a bundle of papers almost as large
as himself, which he placed upon a table in front of
the pulpit desk.</p>

<p>This incident was sensational in itself, promising
all sorts of fearful possibilities; but the congregation
received its greatest jolt when it beheld the Rev.
Dr. Sentelle crippling slowly up the aisle behind
Skeeter, leaning heavily upon his eleven-pound
walking stick.</p>

<p>Dr. Sentelle was the lion of Tickfall, beloved and
magnified by whites and blacks. He was a man
of influence and power for miles around. Intense
courage glowed in his eyes, which held smoldering
flames like the eyes of a jungle beast; tenderness,
gentleness, sweetness, and love, love, love were etched
in the map of his pain-wrinkled face like an illuminated
missal by Bellini; and his beautiful voice
was as sweet as music, every spoken word caressing
like a woman’s hand.</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” Vinegar Atts bellowed at sight of
the white clergyman. “I capsizes right now in
favor of de Revun Dr. Sentelle. He’s gwine fotch
us a Chris’mus message!”</p>

<p>The entire congregation rose to their feet. Vinegar
Atts trotted half-way down the aisle and met the
cripple. With a murmur of thanks, the white man
placed his delicate, blue-veined hand in the crotch of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Vinegar’s powerful arm and stumbled slowly, feebly
forward to the pulpit platform. When he had seated
himself the negroes sank quietly back upon the
benches.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime all the business men in Tickfall
were holding a meeting in the rear of the Tickfall
bank.</p>

<p>“I propose a basket of grub for every nigger cabin
in town!” Gaitskill proclaimed as he sat at the head
of the table. “We have no poor whites in this
village, but the negroes are always hungry.”</p>

<p>There was a unanimous murmur of assent.</p>

<p>Then Gaitskill laughed.</p>

<p>“By the way, what has happened to set all the
coons to cleaning up? I’ve been too dang liberal
with my benefactions&mdash;I’m short sixty-two barrels of
lime!”</p>

<p>“Christmas is coming!” several voices murmured,
and there were many nodding heads, and a broad
grin passed around the table.</p>

<p>“Say, fellers,” Sheriff Flournoy grinned, rising to
his feet and taking a newspaper from his pocket, “er&mdash;ah&mdash;I
beg pardon, are we through with business?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Gaitskill smiled. “We’re agreed that
the niggers get the grub.”</p>

<p>“I started a little joke in town the other day,”
Flournoy went on.</p>

<p>Then he explained about the article he had written,
and read it aloud to them.</p>

<p>There was a whoop of laughter, after which one
asked:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>“Did you get results?”</p>

<p>“No,” Flournoy said disgustedly. “I ought not
to have started it with old Isaiah Gaitskill&mdash;he’s
about half-witted.”</p>

<p>“By George!” Gaitskill exclaimed, springing to
his feet. “That accounts for all this cleaning up and
whitewash&mdash;the niggers are expecting an epidemic
of disease and are getting ready to die!”</p>

<p>Perfect silence greeted this announcement as its
full significance dawned upon each man. Then Dr.
Moseley, the parish health officer, spoke earnestly:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, let us not say one word to the contrary.
Let the darkies clean up and keep clean!”</p>

<p>“I have done good by stealth and blush to find it
fame!” Flournoy interrupted mockingly.</p>

<p>“It means health, gentlemen,” Dr. Moseley declared.
“Health and long life to us all&mdash;er&mdash;by the
way, I propose that as a toast right now!”</p>

<p>For nearly forty years Gaitskill had held this meeting
in the rear of his bank on every Christmas Eve.
The men were familiar with his custom, and the
physician’s suggestion met with instant response.</p>

<p>Gaitskill rose, unlocked his desk, pushed back the
top, and the men gazed with lively anticipation
upon the glasses and decanters there concealed.</p>

<p>“Hitch!” Gaitskill called. “Oh, Hitch Diamond!
Come here!”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Hitch had long before
deserted the colonel and gone to the Shoofly church.</p>

<p>“I bet that coon answers promptly to-morrow
morning,” Gaitskill laughed as he grumblingly filled
the glasses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>“Christmas is coming!” a laughing chorus murmured.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a shout which rolled like
thunder over Tickfall, the sound permeating even
the thick walls of the Tickfall bank.</p>

<p>“Listen to the niggers!” Flournoy grinned.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence; then the mighty
ululations of a negro song floated to them on the
wings of the wind. The men arose.</p>

<p>“Health and long life to us all!” Dr. Moseley
repeated.</p>

<p>“To us all!” the men murmured with nodding
heads. Then they drank.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Time inevitably weakens all reforms. It robs the
greatest and most imminent danger of its terror.
And time completely overthrew the reform in Tickfall
and so endowed the negroes with courage that any
timid darky would have tickled the whiskers of a
bearcat with the end of his flat nose.</p>

<p>The time required to accomplish this relapse was
one day&mdash;the day which comes but once a year&mdash;Christmas!</p>

<p>The day found every negro in Tickfall in a receptive
mood. As a result, every white man in the
town had the privilege of a few moments’ conversation
with all the blacks in the town some time during
the day.</p>

<p>The sun-slashed streets of Tickfall were filled with
them, moving to and fro, like ants in a hill, all
feverish in their activity, and all so shoutingly happy
that the town was as noisy as a parrot’s cage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>Their order of advance was something like this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">a The servants of the household.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">b Those who had been servants during the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">c Servants of former years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">d Those who had done odd jobs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">e Those whose names the white man knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">f Those who knew the white man’s name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">g All the other niggers in town.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And each white man had supplied himself with
about half a barrel of cheap candy, three or four
bunches of bananas, a barrel of apples, a hatful of
small change, and a supply of tobacco, cigars, plugs,
and snuff, bestowing these gifts according to his
inclination.</p>

<p>The first ceremony of the day was the formal
distribution of the eggnog to the servants of the
household.</p>

<p>Of course, after Hitch Diamond, Vinegar Atts,
Figger Bush, and the rest of our colored friends had
spent three days in a frightful ride upon the water-wagon,
their repeated visits to the homes of their
Tickfall white friends where the eggnog foamed
like the surf of the sea had a most demoralizing
effect.</p>

<p>In fact, Hitch Diamond and Vinegar Atts called
upon Marse Tom Gaitskill and made themselves
such nuisances that Gaitskill locked them both up in
an empty corn-crib and turned the water-hose on
them.</p>

<p>Death had no terrors for these people on Christmas
Day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>“Huh!” Hitch Diamond bellowed. “I wouldn’t
be skeart to-day even ef de Revun Dr. Sentelle
hadn’t made us such a purty speech. I done separated
my idears from my habits!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t skeart, neider!” Vinegar Atts whooped.
“Nobody ain’t gwine pat me in de face wid a spadeful
of dirt!”</p>

<p>Christmas baskets came to every cabin; pickaninnies
ran the streets, their pockets filled with pennies, and
their hats laden with oranges, bananas, and cheap
candy; children, white and black, cluttered up the
few asphalt pavements with every sort of Christmas
toys, until the careless pedestrian was in danger of
tripping over some contraption and breaking every
leg he had; and negro women gadded the streets
dressed in finery which was very suggestive to the
white folks of dresses they had seen earlier in the
year in the drawing-rooms of their women.</p>

<p>By nightfall the Hen-Scratch saloon was filled
with negro men, all perfectly sober, and all laughing,
and all happy beyond the dreams of angels.</p>

<p>Figger Bush thrummed a banjo; Pap Curtain had a
fiddle; Mustard Prophet blew a cornet; while every
man exhausted the vocal treasury of his throat for
sounds to add to the volume of music:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I’s as crazy as a loon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fer I gib a silber spoon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a yeller she-coon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On dis here Chris’mus day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a white woman owned it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ said she never loaned it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An’ de cotehouse kotch me right away!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
</div></div>

<p>Vinegar Atts pushed through the crowd, shaking
hands cordially, smiling like a big, fat baby, and
bellowing his congratulations:</p>

<p>“Merry Chris’mus, niggers! Us is done fell from
amazin’ grace to a floatin’ opportunity!”</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” Skeeter Butts squealed. “I’s
shore glad us ain’t refawmed no more! Less all
j’ine hands in a circuous-ring an’ sing dat good ole
favoryte toon, ‘De Star-Spangled Banana’!”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Vinegar Atts bawled. “We is done loss
all our good sense! Less go an’ pay our manners to
de white folks!”</p>

<p>“Lead de way! Lead de way!” a chorus of voices
answered. “Us follers right at yo’ hip!”</p>

<p>Weep and howl, ye dwellers in the East and West
and North, because ye were not in Tickfall on that
Christmas night! Your negroes have cast aside the
supreme gifts which make us love them in the South&mdash;humor,
pathos, laughter, and music!</p>

<p>You listen to your phonographs and try to imagine
what real music is like; you go to grand opera and
think you hear it; but reserve your judgment until
you hear a marching column of negro men, each of
their throats having the range and capacity of a pipe-organ,
and all of their songs set to a sweet minor,
which is characteristic of the music of all enslaved
people since that far distant day when the whip-driven
Israelites “hung their harps on the willows.”</p>

<p>On the Christmas following the close of the Civil
War, the impoverished white people of Tickfall sent
Christmas baskets to their ex-slaves, who were as
poor and hungry as themselves. That night those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
ex-slaves, as an expression of their gratitude to their
old masters, formed in a body and walked from house
to house, singing the songs of the old plantation days.
White women came out upon the porticoes, leaned
their quivering shoulders against the big columns,
and wept uncontrollably in memory of other and
happier days.</p>

<p>White men stumped out upon those same porches
with crutches and canes, or with wooden legs, and
listening, visualized the smoke-fogged battlefields,
the blood-drenched ground, the clash and onsets of
the great war, and beyond the acrid smoke of that
holocaust they beheld a magnificent civilization
which rose in beauty like a dream, and then vanished
forever more. For over half a century this custom
had been observed every Christmas. It survived
the horrors of the Reconstruction Era when Northern
carpet-baggers sought to lead the black race astray
and turn them against their former masters.</p>

<p>And now that marching column had formed again,
two hundred strong, two abreast, with Vinegar Atts
and Hitch Diamond in the lead.</p>

<p>All over Tickfall the white people were waiting for
this, the day’s supreme event. The negroes knew
the favorite songs of all the older citizens. Rev.
Dr. Sentelle listened to “Dixie,” and “Jesus Lover
of my Soul.” Bowing his acknowledgments, Dr.
Sentelle said:</p>

<p>“Boys, when I die, I want you to sing both of those
songs at my funeral!”</p>

<p>And a few years later they did it!</p>

<p>Marse Tom Gaitskill, being a Kentuckian, listened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
to “My Old Kentucky Home,” and to “Darling
Nellie Gray”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, my eyes are getting blinded, and I cannot see my way;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hark! There’s somebody knocking at the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear the angels calling, and I see my Nellie Gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Farewell to my old Kentucky shore!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Leaving one house to go to another, the negroes
always broke into some rollicking plantation melody,
singing it on the way, so that their pilgrimage was a
pilgrimage of song. At the end of the town, remote
from all the negro settlements, was the home of the
sheriff, Mr. John Flournoy, so that the negroes came
to his residence last.</p>

<p>They marched melodiously into his yard, spread
out over the lawn, taking care to trample down none
of the flowers and shrubs, and their mighty voices
reverberated through the valleys and from the hilltops,
and could literally be heard for miles.</p>

<p>Mr. John Flournoy and his gracious wife stood
upon the portico, sometimes smiling, sometimes with
serious faces and moist eyes, as they listened to the
old melodies which had colored the very fiber of their
souls.</p>

<p>Finally a hush fell upon the crowd, and Mr. Flournoy
thought the time for his speech had come. But
not so.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts stepped forward within a few feet
of the porch steps, removed his battered slouch hat,
and began:</p>

<p>“Marse John, all us niggers is been singing to youall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
white folks ever sense we warn’t more’n hawn-high
to a billy-goat. We remembers all dem happy
Chris’mus times of yuther years, an’ we wish we could
keep up dis music eve’y Chris’mus till ole Gabriel
blows his hawn. But de time is done come when us
muss tell you good-by, an’ you won’t never hear our
singin’ no more!”</p>

<p>“Lawd hab mussy!” a chorus of men’s voices
sounded like a prayer.</p>

<p>“You is done been a good frien’ to all us po’ niggers,
Marse John,” Vinegar went on earnestly. “We
hates to go away an’ leave you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The negroes had begun to “weave,” and a moaning
sound issued from every throat like a great organ
tone, and the light of the full moon casting the
shadows of the trees upon the upturned faces of the
men, made an effect funereal and impressive indeed.</p>

<p>“What the devil are you talking about?” Flournoy
demanded in a voice which was almost a scream.</p>

<p>“Us is gittin’ ready to die, Marse John,” Vinegar
told him. “De paper is done printed de word about
all de niggers havin’ dat new kind of epizootic, an’
you rickoleck when de yeller fever kotch us niggers
all of us fell right down in de middle of de big road
an’ died!”</p>

<p>Vinegar took a worn and ragged newspaper out of
his pocket, unfolded it carefully, and handed it to
Sheriff Flournoy. It was one of the copies of the
Tickfall <i>Whoop</i> which Flournoy had given to old
Isaiah Gaitskill several days before.</p>

<p>“You kin read whut de paper says yo’se’f, Marse
John,” Vinegar said.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>That was one time in Mr. John Flournoy’s life
when he wished himself to be somewhere else immediately.
He was an inveterate practical joker,
but he was as tender-hearted as a woman, and it
appalled him that he had administered this wound to
his negro friends on this happiest day of the year.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said painfully, “this article is not true&mdash;it
is a joke! Somebody has been trying to scare
you!”</p>

<p>“Who played dat joke on us, Marse John?”
Vinegar Atts asked.</p>

<p>Flournoy took thirty seconds to consider his answer
to that question, realizing as never before how
very much the truth hurts, when you have to tell it!</p>

<p>“I did it!” he answered, and the words strangled
in his throat.</p>

<p>There was one minute of perfect silence.</p>

<p>Then Vinegar Atts replied with just two words:
“Ye-es, suh!”</p>

<p>Slowly he turned and started toward the street,
Hitch Diamond walking beside him. Two and two,
the crowd of negroes silently fell into line and marched
out.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts was the last to leave.</p>

<p>As Skeeter started through the gate he felt Flournoy’s
heavy hand upon his shoulder and winced.</p>

<p>“Tell me the truth, you little yeller devil!” Flournoy
drawled. “Didn’t you niggers know all the
time that that was a joke?”</p>

<p>Skeeter chuckled evasively. He had no intention
of revealing a secret of the most secretive race in the
world; least of all did he intend to make trouble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
between the white folks by revealing the fact that
Dr. Sentelle, pitying the fright and ignorance of the
negroes, had investigated, learned the facts, and
informed them.</p>

<p>But the sheriff’s hand upon his shoulder was suggestive
of the majesty and might of the law, and
Skeeter had a mortal fear of getting, as he would have
expressed it, “into a lawsuit wid de cotehouse.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Skeeter chuckled. “We did learn a
leetle about dat befo’ Chris’mus. We borrowed a
lot of papers from de white folks an’ didn’t see nothin’
about it in deir papers, so us soupspicioned dat you
had done got up a buzzo on us. But us is all Christians,
Marse John&mdash;we don’t bear you no grudge!”</p>

<p>Then he slipped from the hand of the law and ran
laughing down the street.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="A_Mascot_Jinx">A Mascot Jinx</h2>


<p>“Dis here cullud lady is gwine be my wife. I
make you ’quainted wid Coco Ferret!”</p>

<p>Love had flushed the saddle-colored face of Skeeter
Butts to a brownish-crimson, and the gorgeous
splendor of his clothes reflected the sunburst of
affection in his heart.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond held out his hand to a fat, dumpy,
simple-faced country negro girl, and grinned.</p>

<p>“Huh,” he chuckled, as Coco Ferret shook hands,
“dis here gal is all soft and puffed-up an’ squeezy
like a big balloom.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Skeeter grinned, eying the girl
with a prideful gaze. “I likes ’em dat way. Edgecated
niggers is too slim an’ active. Dey gits biggity
an’ bumptious. Dey axes ’terrogations an’ is bawn
to trouble.”</p>

<p>“Dis lady oughter make a good-pervidin’ cook an’
housekeeper,” Hitch suggested, looking her over as
if she were a horse which Skeeter had bought.</p>

<p>“I shore is bofe dem things,” the girl responded.
“Skeeter ain’t gittin’ no set-easy gal.”</p>

<p>“I hopes you’ll bofe be as happy as married
niggers ever is,” Hitch remarked politely.</p>

<p>“Happy is our name, Hitch,” Skeeter declared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
confidently. “Dis here gal is already fotch me luck,
an’ I’s gwine use her fer our mascop in de ball game
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Whut is de word about de game, Skeeter?”
Hitch grunted. “Is us gwine win?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter declared. “I done bet fawty
dollars. Coco is bet ten dollars. I b’lieves in bettin’
all I kin git.”</p>

<p>“Dem Sawtown niggers is powerful pert players,
Skeeter,” Hitch warned him. “Dey wucks reg’lar
in de big sawmill, an’ dey got plenty muscle an’ wind.
Dey plays baseball all day on eve’y Sunday, an’ dey
keeps in fine practice. Dey all ’pears like new-issue
niggers to me&mdash;slick-heads, plum’ full of tricks, an’
dangersome.”</p>

<p>Skeeter turned and looked over the picnic grounds
where a number of husky blacks were prancing around
with the women. They all wore their baseball suits,
and these uniforms drew the women like a barrel of
sugar attracts flies.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, I admits dem facks,” Skeeter said.
“But look at de baseball team us is got&mdash;Figger
Bush is de best pitcher in Loozanny; Prince Total
ketches; Mustard Prophet straddles fust base&mdash;us is
been playin’ all summer, an’ we is winned eve’y
game up to now!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so,” Hitch remarked, with less uneasiness
in his voice. “I reckin I’ll bet eve’y dollar dat I’m
got.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de talk,” Skeeter applauded. “I been
pussuadin’ all de players on de Tickfall team to bet
all de money dey had.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>“Dat ain’t good bizziness,” Hitch declared. “Ef
players bets deir own dollars an’ de team is losin’,
dey all gits rattled.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so, wid white folks,” Skeeter replied.
“But ’tain’t so wid niggers. You know how niggers
is&mdash;ef dey think de yuther man is gwine lose money
on deir wuck, dey don’t pay no mind, an’ de Lawd’s
will kin be did. But ef a nigger figgers dat he’s
gwine lose money on his own se’f&mdash;Lawdy, he shore
do scratch gravel!”</p>

<p>Their conversation was brought to a close by a
long blast upon a fox-horn.</p>

<p>“Dat means de picnic dinner is sot,” Skeeter interpreted.
“Us better hurry or all dem yuther niggers
will wollop up de grub.”</p>

<p>As they took their places at the long table where
the food was piled up in an appalling and unappetizing
mass, Vinegar Atts bellowed:</p>

<p>“Who is de she-queen you is armin’ aroun’,
Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“Dis here is my gwine-be wife,” Skeeter grinned.
“Her name’s Coco.”</p>

<p>“It’s ’bout time you wus gittin’ married an’ sottled
down,” Rev. Vinegar Atts proclaimed, scenting a
wedding fee. “Den you’ll be king of de coconut
tree. Ef you puts off gettin’ married too long, you
gits outen de habit of wantin’ to be.”</p>

<p>“Me an’ Coco is got de same mind now,” Skeeter
snickered, proud of the attention they were attracting.
“Coco is de mascop at de ball game dis afternoon.”</p>

<p>At the far end of the table the manager of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Sawtown team heard this last remark and uttered an
exclamation. Stepping over to one of his players
he asked:</p>

<p>“Buff’lo, how come us fergot to fetch a mascop
along wid us?”</p>

<p>“Dunno, cap,” Buffalo replied. “I got my
rabbit’s foot.”</p>

<p>“Dem Tickfall coons is got a woman fer a mascop,”
the manager said. “An dey got Figger Bush
fer a pitcher, an’ Prince Total ketches. Dat powerful
arrangement shore looks bad to me.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t us hoodoo Figger?” Buffalo inquired.</p>

<p>“How is dat did?” Manager Star asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Make a cross on Figger’s head wid a rabbit foot,”
Buffalo informed him.</p>

<p>“Dat’s easy,” Star grinned. “Gimme yo’ foot,
Buff’lo.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Sawtown manager sidled up
to Figger Bush and remarked:</p>

<p>“You gotter pitch hard dis atternoon, Figger. I
thinks you needs some nourishment. I gives you dis
big, yeller awange as a peace-off’rin’.”</p>

<p>As Figger, grinning, reached out for the orange,
Star let it fall from his hand and roll under the table.
Figger went down on his hands and knees, crawled
under the table for his gift, and when he came out
felt some sharp object scraped across his woolly
scalp. When he stood up he beheld Manager Star
grinning at him, holding up a mangy rabbit foot.</p>

<p>“Sawtown wins de game to-day, Figger,” Star
snickered. “I done cross yo’ head wid a rabbit foot,
an’ luck ain’t wid yo’ no mo’.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>Figger Bush turned almost white.</p>

<p>As Star walked away, Figger turned every pocket
in his clothes wrong side out, found every cent of
money he had in his possession, and crammed it into
his mouth. Stooping down, he made a cross in the
sand with his middle finger, drew a large ring around
the cross, and dropped the money out of his mouth into
the center of the ring. Then from under each coin
he gathered a tiny pinch of dirt, placed it in the palm
of his left hand, turned around three times with his eyes
closed, and tossed the grains of dirt over his head.</p>

<p>Thus he hoped to break the hoodoo. But uneasiness
filled his soul.</p>

<p>“My Gawd,” he sighed. “I shore feels powerful
bad.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At two o’clock that afternoon four hundred
negroes stood around the baseball diamond and
cheered the Tickfall team as they went to the field
and the Sawtown visitors went to bat.</p>

<p>Figger Bush, the famous Tickfall pitcher, rubbed
his hands with dirt, tightened his belt, took a chew of
tobacco, waved one foot in the air, and pitched his
first ball. Kerplunk! It landed in the stomach of
the Sawtown batter, doubled him up, and dropped
him in a heap on top of the plate.</p>

<p>Two delighted, grinning, Sawtown teammates
caught the injured man by the arms, lifted him, and
escorted him to first base, enlivening their progress
down the line by directing to Figger Bush certain
remarks which were calculated to reduce his self-esteem
to the minimum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>The second batter hit the first ball, sent it far over
in the high weeds back of center field; then he and the
injured teammate loped leisurely into home.</p>

<p>“Git yo’ eye steady, Figger!” Butts squealed.
“Don’t let ’em rattle you up!”</p>

<p>“Figger, Figger, he’s de nigger!” the Sawtown men
bawled. “We done got dat nigger’s figger!”</p>

<p>Once more Bush wound up to pitch the ball, but
the moment he brought his arm back for the whiplike
throw, the ball slipped out of his fingers, rolled
weakly across the diamond, and was retrieved by the
third-baseman.</p>

<p>Every member of the Sawtown team sprang into
the air, emitted ecstatic whoops, and plastered the
helpless Figger with every name in their vocabulary
which they thought would stick.</p>

<p>When Bush finally threw the ball it went over the
plate ten feet in the air, and a giggling batboy chased
it until it struck against a stump on the edge of the
bayou and stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh, Figger!” Skeeter screamed, with a sob in his
voice. “Whut’s de matter, pardner? Whut ails
ye? I got my dollars on ye, Figger; buck up, fer
Gawd’s sake&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bush’s answer was a pitched ball which struck the
ground three feet in front of the plate, bounced waist-high
to the batter, and was slugged far over in the left
field, where it fell in a slough, and the fielder had to
wade in the muck to his knees to get it.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Figger!” the Sawtown players
shrieked. “You suits us fine! Don’t let Skeeter
Butts git yo’ goat!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>Figger’s eyes twitched, his jaws worked on his
tobacco quid like a mill, his knees grew weak and
wabbly. He wound up to throw the ball, then suddenly
stopped his operations, straightened up, and
felt at the top of his head as if something had hit him.</p>

<p>He threw four balls in rapid succession, not one of
which came within ten feet of the plate, and the
batter walked to the first.</p>

<p>He threw another ball, hit the batter on the elbow,
and he walked to first.</p>

<p>He threw another ball, the batter tapped it, and it
dropped at the feet of Figger Bush.</p>

<p>Figger wiped the bitter sweat out of both eyes,
stooped down with great deliberation, picked up the
ball, wiped the dust off of it on his ragged shirt, and
threw it to first just as the three Sawtown men came
over the home plate!</p>

<p>“Keep it up, ole boy!” the Sawtown men screamed.
“You kin do it&mdash;you got us all guessin’&mdash;make us
run de bases&mdash;dat’s de right boy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, fer de Lawd’s sake, Figger,” Skeeter squealed,
“see ef you cain’t pitch jes’ one straight ball! Don’t
put nothin’ on it&mdash;jes’ throw it straight an’ easy!”</p>

<p>Figger threw it straight and easy. A child could
have hit it with a lead-pencil. What the batter did
to that ball will never be known. It sailed over the
top of the highest trees like a bird, and is lying hidden
in the Dorfoche woods yet. Then this colored Ty
Cobb walked around the bases and sat down on the
home plate, conversing in the meantime with Figger
Bush with choice language.</p>

<p>Prince Total threw aside his mask and chest-protector
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
and walked down to the pitcher’s box just as
the umpire tossed out a new ball.</p>

<p>“Figger, you is de wust pitcher I ever seen!”
Prince howled. “You git up dar an’ ketch, an’
lemme see kin I fan dese niggers out. My Gawd,
you muss be crippled under yo’ hat to play ball like
you is doin’!”</p>

<p>“I is,” Figger replied, rubbing his woolly scalp
like a man in a dream.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts left the coaching line, ran into the
crowd, and seized Coco Ferret by a fat arm.</p>

<p>“Come on outen dis crowd, honey!” he squeaked.
“Oh, Lawdy, ef you never done no mascoppin’
before, you git to doin’ it now! Dis is awful!”</p>

<p>“How is mascoppin’ done, Skeeter?” she inquired
as the little darky dragged her out of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows!” Skeeter panted as he led her out
to where all the Tickfall team could see her from the
field. “You jes’ nachelly be it&mdash;like a luck charm.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the players and howled:</p>

<p>“I done got yo’ mascop out in front, Prince! Look
at dis pretty nigger gal an’ pick up a brave heart!
Set yo’ eye on Coco and do yo’ durndest! Don’t
let nothin’ skeer you, Prince, fer good luck’s done
busted right in yo’ face!”</p>

<p>Prince Total, thus admonished, retired the Sawtown
nine with only three pitched balls. Each
batter knocked a fly which was caught in the field.</p>

<p>The Tickfall nine was suddenly jubilant. Four
hundred Tickfall fans bellowed with joy. Skeeter
Butts ran to Coco Ferret, threw his arms around her,
an’ giggled:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you little, fat mascop! You done bust de bad
luck! Eve’y nigger in dis town loves you like a brudder&mdash;an’
me, you done winned my heart ferever an’ ever!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Tickfall team came in to bat, Hitch
Diamond puffed through the crowd like a steam-engine
and started a row.</p>

<p>“Whut de debbil you mean by throwin’ dis game,
Figger?” he howled in irate tones. “Whut de
trouble wid yo’ head? Don’t you know you is losin’
yo’ own good money?”</p>

<p>“Trouble?” Figger Bush bawled. “Dem Sawtown
niggers done put a hoodoo sign on me!”</p>

<p>“How come?” Hitch asked in a changed tone.</p>

<p>“Dey crisscrossed my head wid a rabbit foot.”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Hitch howled, and his eyes looked
scared. “Why ain’t you stood pigeontoed when you
pitched, Figger? Dat’d bust de sign.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Hitch!” Pap Curtain snarled as he came
into the crowd. “You stop lowratin’ dat Figger
Bush. I done made inquirements, an’ I foun’ out
dat all dem Sawtown coons is got a buzzard’s feather
in deir hat an’ snake-dust in deir shoes, an’ a raw pertater
in deir pocket. Dey done sot deir triggers fer
luck, and dey got all de rabbit foots in Sawtown
hung roun’ deir necks!”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” mourned Skeeter Butts, “dem niggers
hadn’t oughter did us dataway.”</p>

<p>“Of co’se, I couldn’t do nothin’!” Figger Bush
declared defensively. “Eve’y time I picked up dat
ball it begun to claw at de inside of my hand jes’ like
I wus holdin’ a live Jume bug!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Prince Total agreed. “Ef dem fust
three balls I pitched hadn’t fotch dem niggers out,
I never could ’a’ tossed anodder over dat plate.
Dat ball’s got de slickments, an’ wiggles like a live
snake!”</p>

<p>“Shore!” the fielders agreed with awed voices.
“Somepin shore ails dat ball&mdash;dey muss hab rubbed
it wid eel-juice!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts listened to this with ever decreasing
hopes of victory for the team.</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy, niggers!” he sighed helplessly.
“Think of all de dollars we is losin’. Ain’t dar no
way to cross dem Sawtown hoodoo signs?”</p>

<p>“Us might try it,” Hitch Diamond said as he dived
his hand into his pocket for his lucky charms. “Less
dec’rate de fust batter wid all our luck pieces!”</p>

<p>“Batter up!” the umpire bawled for the tenth
time.</p>

<p>Thereupon Prince Total went to bat, stuffing
things in his pockets until they bulged like the pockets
of a boy who had been on a visit to an apple
orchard. He had rabbits’ feet and buzzards’ feathers,
iron rings and iron bolts, buckeyes and raw
potatoes, rattlesnake rattles and birds’ claws, teeth
of horses and tusks of hogs, locks of hair and four-leaf
clovers, rings and chains and rubber bands, beer-checks
and copper pennies&mdash;a veritable witch’s brew
of trifles.</p>

<p>Standing at the plate with all this equipment of
luck, he bunted the ball to the feet of the shortstop,
started to first base carrying his bat, tangled the
bat up between his legs, fell on his head, and scattered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
his luck-charms all over that part of the
diamond.</p>

<p>A loud groan went up from the throats of the
spectators, and Prince got up, picked up his scattered
trinkets, placing them in his hat, and laid
them at the feet of Skeeter Butts with a sheepish grin.</p>

<p>“I had too many of dem things, fellers,” he explained.
“Too much luck is more’n a plenty. I
couldn’t tote it all!”</p>

<p>Then Figger Bush fanned wildly at two balls, shut
his eyes and took a lick at the third, hit himself on
his own shin with the bat, and came limping back,
nursing his crippled leg, and muttering profane
things.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Skeeter had loaded down Mustard
Prophet with all the hoodoo charms which
Figger had carried and a large assortment which
Hitch had accumulated by solicitation among the
fans. They were in his shoes, in his belt, in his cap,
in his shirt; he rubbed snake-dust on his hands,
sprinkled magic powder on his woolly head, and
went to bat as uneasy as a condemned criminal
facing the electric chair.</p>

<p>“Lam de ball, Mustard!” Skeeter howled. “Put
some ginger on de bat, Mustard! You’s puffeckly
safe&mdash;you done crossed de hoodoo sign on ’em! I’s
prayin’ fer you, Mustard!”</p>

<p>Skeeter’s prayers were not answered.</p>

<p>Mustard saw the first ball coming and jumped ten
feet away. He struck at the second ball after it was
in the catcher’s mitt, and he struck twice at the
third ball&mdash;once while the pitcher was winding up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
and again when the ball was forty feet from the
plate. Then he walked back to Skeeter, delivered
of all his lucky pieces, and joined the Tickfall team
on its way to the field.</p>

<p>Then Vinegar Atts walked up and laid his hand
on Skeeter’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Looky here, Skeeter!” he bellowed. “All us
niggers is losin’ our dollars on dis here game! I
b’lieves dat dis game has been fixed!”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so, Elder,” Skeeter denied tearfully. “I
done bet fawty dollars on dis game, an’ I’s gwine lose
eve’y cent of dat an’ ten dollars dat my gal bet!”</p>

<p>“Whut ails dis Tickfall team?” Vinegar wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Dem Sawtowners done got de hoodoo sign on
’em,” Skeeter explained. “I tried to bust de hoodoo
when us wus at bat, but it cain’t be did.”</p>

<p>Vinegar shook his fat fist at the face of Butts.</p>

<p>“I tells you dis, solemn an’ specific, Skeeter: dese
here cullud pussons is bet deir few money on yo’
recommend. Dey don’t figger on no hoodoo or no
nothin’! Ef you done gone an’ fixed dis game, all I
gotter say is, you better unhoodoo our team befo’
dis crowd of coons make up deir minds whut dey
gwine do to you fer sellin’ us out to de Sawtowners!”</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts walked away with a majestic air, and
Skeeter Butts sat down on the ground beside Coco
Ferret, wiping the copious sweat from his face.</p>

<p>“O Lawd,” he prayed, “ef I only but had a jinx!”</p>

<p>“Whut am a jinx, Skeeter?” Coco inquired.</p>

<p>“It’s a cross-eyed female woman,” Skeeter declared,
looking at Coco hopefully. But Coco’s eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
were round as a buckshot and straight, perfectly
straight.</p>

<p>With a groan Skeeter placed his face in his two
hands and mourned:</p>

<p>“We’s gwine lose all our dollars, Coco&mdash;dar ain’t
no hope!”</p>

<p>“Whut did Vinegar Atts specify de niggers wus
gwine do to you?” Coco asked.</p>

<p>“He ain’t say,” Skeeter told her, speaking from a
heart filled with misery and dreadful foreboding.
“I ’speck dey’s gwine hang me.”</p>

<p>A wild yell from the Sawtown rooters caused him
to glance up listlessly. The slaughter had begun
again. With another groan he dropped his head
and gave himself up to deep thought.</p>

<p>A sharp crack of hickory against horsehide&mdash;Skeeter
looked up and saw the Tickfall center-fielder
fumbling with the ball, picking it up and dropping it
three times, while four hilarious Sawtown men came
in and scored.</p>

<p>Skeeter rose to his feet, dusted the seat of his duck
trousers, and said to Coco:</p>

<p>“Little gal, you set right here till I gits back.
Dar ain’t no cross-eyed gals in dis whole town, but
I’m gotter bust dat hoodoo sign onless I hankers to
die, which ain’t so. Is you willin’ to he’p me?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Coco assured him.</p>

<p>“All right. You set right here an’ keep on mascoppin’!
I’s gwine to Tickfall.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Skeeter ran the quarter of a mile to Tickfall,
jumped into the door of the drug-store, and panted:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>“Please, suh, I wants a jar of dat white stuff whut
de lady folks puts on deir complexion.”</p>

<p>“Cold cream?” the clerk inquired.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh; it’s a kind of paste whut dey puts
on wid a little sponge.”</p>

<p>“I got you,” the clerk answered, reaching up on a
shelf and lifting down a jar. “Face enamel. You
go’ner try to git white, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh; nothin’ like dat. Dis is fer a cullud
lady pusson,” Skeeter snickered as he laid the money
on the counter. “How long do it take dis stuff to
dry atter you put it on yo’ mug?”</p>

<p>“About a minute.”</p>

<p>“Kin you gib me a little piece of sponge to smear
it on wid?”</p>

<p>The grinning clerk tossed him the sponge, and
Skeeter went loping down the street to a dry-goods
store.</p>

<p>“Gimme a thick, black veil ’bout a yard long!” he
exclaimed. “I wants a mournin’ veil!”</p>

<p>With this article clutched in his hand he ran all
the way back to the ball game.</p>

<p>“Whut de sco’, Hitch?” he squealed as he ran
through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight to nothin’ favor erf de Sawtowns,”
Hitch grunted with a malignant stare at Skeeter.
“You better git busy, Skeeter Butts, an’ bust dis
hoodoo&mdash;ef it is a hoodoo. Dese here niggers wut
bet deir money is ackin’ powerful peevish an’ specify
dat you done sold ’em out&mdash;I favors dat view
myse’f.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s jes’ de way wid niggers,” Skeeter whined.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
“Dey been winnin’ money offen dis nine all summer,
an’ now when us is struck a losin’ streak dey talks
’bout mobbin’ me!”</p>

<p>He ran over to where Coco Ferret sat. She
looked up and said:</p>

<p>“Whut muss I do, Skeeter? I been tryin’ to
mascop, but dat don’t do no good!”</p>

<p>“Come wid me, honey!” Skeeter replied, and led
her through the crowd and into the picnic grounds,
where a growth of underbrush screened them from
view.</p>

<p>There he produced his jar of face-enamel, and
explained:</p>

<p>“Coco, my maw wus de greates’ hoodoo dorctor
in dis parish. When she died she gimme dis jar of
hoodoo juice an’ tole me ef I would rub it on de face
of de gal I loved dat gal would bust any hoodoo sign
in de worl’. I loves you best of all, an’ ef you ain’t
got no real good objections I’ll an’int yo’ mug wid dis
juice.”</p>

<p>“Do it hurt?” Coco asked.</p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter declared.</p>

<p>He took her hand, rubbed the enamel over the
back of her wrist, and wiped it off quickly, leaving
the skin coal-black as before.</p>

<p>“It makes de hide feel cold like ice,” Coco giggled
as she took off her hat and held her head back.
“Smear it on thick, Skeeter!”</p>

<p>Skeeter dipped his sponge in the enamel and
gladly smeared it on thick. He wiped the mess
across the girl’s forehead, down each cheek, and
under her chin. The black skin under that whitening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
made the most poisonous-looking combination
imaginable.</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine put dis close aroun’ yo’ eyes,
honey,” Skeeter declared. “I’ll jes’ make a nice
roun’ ring roun’ yo’ eyes an’ yo’ mouth because I’s
skeart it might sting ef it got in dem places.”</p>

<p>“Smear it on thick, Skeeter,” the girl snickered.
“It shore feels cold an’ smells sweet.”</p>

<p>In two minutes Skeeter looked upon the work
which his hand had made, and pronounced it very
good.</p>

<p>“Dat’ll shore fetch ’em, Coco,” he giggled. “When
our mascop shows up all greased wid hoodoo-ile
somepin is gwine be doin’ wid dem Sawtown coons!”</p>

<p>He laid his black veil on Coco’s lap.</p>

<p>“Now, honey, you let dat juice dry a minute, den
you put dat veil over yo’ hat an’ down over yo’
face.”</p>

<p>Skeeter helped her to adjust the veil, and they
were ready.</p>

<p>Ecstatic whoops from the Sawtown team came to
their ears, informing them that the massacre was
still in progress.</p>

<p>The score stood thirty-seven to nothing in favor of
Sawtown, and the Sawtown captain grew weary of
the game.</p>

<p>“You fellers stop hittin’ dat ball! We got to
play at least five innings befo’ we kin be shore of
gittin’ our bet-money,” he bellowed. “Us is done
got ’em beat&mdash;fan out! Eve’y batter is ordered to
fan out!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s suits me,” Skeeter snickered as this command
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
was expressed loud enough for everyone to
hear. “Dey’ll change deir tune in a minute. Dey’ll
want to hit de ball an’ cain’t!”</p>

<p>The Sawtown batters, responsive to the captain’s
order, went out&mdash;one, two, three.</p>

<p>Again Tickfall was at the bat&mdash;the last half of the
second inning.</p>

<p>“Now, Coco,” Skeeter said as a scar-faced negro
named Possum picked up the bat and went to the
plate. “Dis is yo’ time to git busy an’ save de day.
You stand over dar&mdash;as close to fust base as you kin
git. I’s gwine over an’ stand by third base. Don’t
you raise up yo’ veil until I gives de sign.”</p>

<p>“Whut is de sign?” Coco giggled.</p>

<p>“When I lifts my hat like I wus bowin’ to a lady
den you raise up yo’ veil, an’ stick it up on top of yo’
hat.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Coco agreed. “I’ll watch fer de
sign.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Hey, fellers!” the Sawtown pitcher whooped as
he pointed toward first base. “Look at de Tickfall
mascop all diked out in black mournin’! Dey got her
fixed right now!”</p>

<p>Loud yells from the Sawtown players greeted this
remark, and a moment later the Sawtown pitcher
delivered the ball. Possum bunted it toward the
shortstop, and started for first base like a rabbit.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts raised his hat with a most exaggerated
bow.</p>

<p>Coco Ferret raised her veil.</p>

<p>Possum never reached first base.

<p>He took one look at Coco’s face, gave utterance
to a howl which would have frightened a European
war general, and started for left field by way of the
pitcher’s box, looking behind him and whining like
a dog.</p>

<p>Just as the shortstop threw to first the Sawtown
first-baseman got a look at Coco’s face.</p>

<p>“My gosh!” he whooped.</p>

<p>His arms dropped paralyzed to his sides, he received
the baseball full in his stomach, and started
after Possum at his best gait.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” the Sawtown pitcher yelped; his
glove fell from his hand, and he started away.</p>

<p>“Dat gal’s got some kind of ketchin’ disease!”
the third-baseman squalled; and thereupon he and
the second-baseman, the shortstop, and the catcher
started after the pitcher in wild flight, looking behind
them as if fearful that the object of their fright would
pursue them.</p>

<p>Coco Ferret, lacking a woman’s best friend&mdash;a
mirror&mdash;and having no idea of her horrific appearance,
turned and grinned at the crowd of Tickfall
negroes, delighted with her success as a hoodoo
breaker.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;my&mdash;Lawd A’mighty!” Vinegar Atts bellowed,
his eyes popping with fright, his mouth
spread wide in horrified imbecility. “Whut is
Gawd done gone an’ done to dat gal? Run, niggers,
run!”</p>

<p>Vinegar’s hand was pointing Coco out to the crowd,
but the girl at that moment was looking toward
Skeeter Butts, grinning like a drunken nightmare.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>The crowd paused just long enough to look.</p>

<p>What they saw was a girl who had been shiny-black
two hours before&mdash;but now her face was white,
with black rings around the eyes and mouth; a
ghastly, horrible whiteness, poisonous-looking and
appalling, enough to frighten any sane man into
jimjams.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts started toward Tickfall, bellowing
like a cow.</p>

<p>Four hundred squalling blacks fell in behind him,
fighting for room to run, grabbing at each other’s
coat tails to accelerate their speed, taking frightened
glances behind them every moment, then adding
another octave to the vocalization of their fright.</p>

<p>Out on the highroad they kicked up the dust and
sand like a cyclone, but the dust-cloud did not
obscure the light-blue dress of Coco Ferret as she
trotted down the road behind them.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts trotted behind Coco, cackling like a
hen.</p>

<p>“Keep it up, honey!” he squawked. “You shore
is a grand little hoodoo sign buster! Chase ’em
plum’ to town! You done saved our money an’
saved my life!”</p>

<p>At the little bridge over the Coolie Creek on the
edge of Tickfall, Skeeter Butts tried to stop her.</p>

<p>“Less blow a while an’ rest our foots, Coco,” he
snickered. “Lawd, dat shore wus a dandy race!”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Coco declared. “I ain’t gwine rest till I
gits home! Dis here mess is hot on my face. It wus
cool at fust.”</p>

<p>“Pull down yo’ veil, honey!” Skeeter begged her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
“Dis here face juice is too precious fer igernunt
niggers to see.”</p>

<p>Coco adjusted her veil, and they lingered a moment
at the bridge, cooling off under the shade of the
trees. Finally Coco asked:</p>

<p>“Skeeter, wus dem niggers runnin’ away from me?”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter declared. “It wus dat hoodoo
juice dat sont ’em skootin’ home. My maw shore
told de truth ’bout dat juice.”</p>

<p>“Kin I have de rest of de juice, Skeeter?” Coco
asked as they strolled slowly toward her cabin.</p>

<p>“Suttinly!” Skeeter said, producing the little jar
from his pocket. “But I bet you don’t never use it
no more, Coco.”</p>

<p>“I bet I does,” Coco giggled as they walked up
the steps of her cabin.</p>

<p>The girl laid her hat and veil on the bed and sat
down.</p>

<p>Skeeter broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Whut you laughin’ at, nigger?” Coco demanded.</p>

<p>“Go, take a peep at yo’se’f in de lookin’-glass.
Coco,” Skeeter cackled. “Oh, my goodness gracious
Moses&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, caught hold of the mantel
with both hands, and hung there, helpless
with laughter, his alligator mouth stretched to the
limit.</p>

<p>Coco walked to the mirror.</p>

<p>“My stars an’ garters!” she howled at sight of her
face. “Skeeter Butts, is you made me look like de
debbil’s wife on purpose?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Skeeter whooped. “I wus ’bout to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
lose my bets&mdash;fawty dollars fer me an’ ten fer
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is you made me look like dis to save you money?”
Coco demanded in irate tones. “You treat yo’
gwine-be wife like dat?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m!” Skeeter shrieked amid his paroxysms
of laughter. “Oh, my honey bird&mdash;you is de dangest
sight ever I did see since de day I wus borned on&mdash;whoop-ee!”</p>

<p>Coco suddenly snatched open the drawer of her
bureau, and Skeeter saw the malignant gleam of a
nickel-plated, pearl-handled revolver.</p>

<p>“Murder-r-r!” he shrieked as he shot through the
door with the speed of a comet.</p>

<p>As he passed out of the door a bullet flattened
against the jamb close to his face.</p>

<p>As he passed through the yard gate the splinters
from two more bullets were shattered from the posts
close beside him.</p>

<p>As he galloped wildly down the street two more
bullets kicked up the dust around his flying feet.</p>

<p>He bounced through the swinging doors of the
Hen-Scratch saloon and found his establishment
crowded with negroes demanding back the money
they had bet.</p>

<p>“All bets is declared off, niggers!” Skeeter panted.</p>

<p>He sank weakly into a chair, wiped the sweat from
his face with a trembling hand, fanned himself with
his hat for a moment, then made another announcement:</p>

<p>“All my weddin’ arrangements is declared off, too,
niggers!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>“How come?” the Rev. Vinegar Atts demanded,
saddened by the loss of a wedding fee.</p>

<p>Skeeter panted for breath, and finally explained:</p>

<p>“Dat female mascop is done jinxed me!”

<h3>I<br />

TICK PROMISES</h3>

<p>Tick Hush looked like a negro who would work
like a horse, and who would do as he was told.</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill leaned back in his swivel
chair for a comprehensive survey of this new applicant
for a job.</p>

<p>He saw a brown-skinned man, with a big round
head, a flat nose, heavy lips that were easy-smiling,
and eyes which were as wide-open, as simple and
innocent as the black, glass eyes of a china doll. He
noticed that the man stood perfectly straight, without
nervousness, and that his big hands were hard
and square&mdash;the hands of a willing worker.</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ but how to wuck de lan’,
Marse Tom,” Tick told him. “Farmin’ is my trade.
So when I heerd tell dat you done bought dat farm
whar de ole pest-house was located at, I figgered dat
dis wus a chance to git me a good job wid a good
boss.”</p>

<p>The speech won Gaitskill’s favor. Negroes are
afraid of hospitals, quarantine stations, and graveyards.
He had had difficulty in securing a negro
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
tenant for this newly acquired farm because the pest-house
occupied a portion of the plantation.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid of that farm, Tick?” Gaitskill
smiled.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Tick chuckled. “De cullud folks
orate ’bout all dem bad ketchin’ diseases in de pest-house,
but I ain’t gwine pester aroun’ in dat neighborhood
none.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill determined to test the negro’s sincerity
once for all.</p>

<p>“Think of the people who have died out there,
Tick,” he said. “When I was a boy there was an
epidemic of cholera, and the people died in that old
stone house like flies. After that there was yellow
fever, and nobody who was taken into that house for
quarantine ever came out alive. There have been
epidemics of diphtheria, scarlet fever, and smallpox.
People are buried all around that quarantine station&mdash;you
mean to tell me that you are not afraid?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, I ain’t skeart,” Tick grinned. “Dem
folks is all been dead so long dey done fergot whut
dey died of. Dem bad ketchin’ diseases is done
kotch on to somebody else by dis time an’ been toted
away. Of co’se, I ain’t gwine dig fer no buried
money aroun’ dat spot.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of that,” Gaitskill told him.</p>

<p>“An’ I don’t figger on havin’ much comp’ny out
dar,” Tick chuckled. “Niggers ain’t gwine make
my place no hangout. Ef I got inter real bad
trouble, I might could hide in dat pest-house&mdash;nobody
ain’t comin’ dar atter me.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” Gaitskill smiled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
“But I will not object if your idle, loafing friends
stay away. At the same time, I presume you will
often be lonesome&mdash;are you married?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill leaned back in his chair and tapped the
top of the table with the rubber of his pencil.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you married, Tick?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Cain’t affode it, Marse Tom.”</p>

<p>“How do you know you can’t?” Gaitskill asked
curiously.</p>

<p>“I figgered dat all out once, boss,” Tick grinned.
“I wus wuckin’ as a wage-han’ on de Coon-Skin
plantation. I tuck a notion I wus qualified to take a
wife, I wus shore I could git one, but I warn’t
shore I could suppote her.”</p>

<p>“How did you decide that matter?” Gaitskill
asked.</p>

<p>“I wus doin’ my own cookin’ an’ livin’ in a cabin
by myse’f alone, so I fixed up a way to try it out.
I sot two plates at de table. Eve’y time I et a biskit,
I sot a biskit on dat yuther plate. Eve’y time I
he’ped myse’f to a b’ilin’ of greens, I put some on dat
yuther plate. Eve’y time I wanted a corn pone, I
baked two in de hot ash, and’ throwed one of ’em out
to my houn’ dawg. At de eend of de month I counted
up my money whut wus lef’ over, an’&mdash;my Gawd,
boss&mdash;it shore cain’t be did by me. Keepin’ a wife is
too blame expenshus.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill pulled his heavy silken mustache down
over his mouth to hide his widely smiling lips. Thus
disheveled, he resembled a venerable walrus with an
amiable disposition. After a while he spoke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>“I want a married man for the quarantine plantation,
Tick. There is a good house on the other side
of the farm from the pest-house, and there is ample
accommodation for cows, chickens, and hogs. There’s
a good garden plot and a number of fruit trees. An
unmarried man won’t attend to these things, and I
want some one who will keep the place up.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s powerful bad news, Marse Tom,” Tick
replied as he took a step backward toward the door.
“I suttinly had my whole insides sot on gittin’ charge
of dat plantation. Yes, suh.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill sat waiting, confidently anticipating
Tick’s next remark. The colored man’s mental
processes were slow, but at last he arrived.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I might could git me a wife, Marse
Tom,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s the very idea I had in mind,” Gaitskill
smiled. “If you promise to get married within the
next two weeks, I’ll locate you on the pest-house
plantation for the next five years.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe no woman won’t take no ole tough gizzard
like me,” Tick remarked with humility.</p>

<p>“That’s up to you,” Gaitskill laughed. “I think
if you will emphasize the fact that you are getting the
management of a good farm, a good house, plenty of
fruit, a number of cows, chickens, and a good garden,
and the woman is sure that you will put as much on
her plate as you do on your own&mdash;well, try it, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I’ll shore try it on,” the negro answered with
ludicrous solemnity as he turned and started out of
the door.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>“And, listen, Tick!” Gaitskill exclaimed as he
turned to pick up some papers on his desk and resume
his interrupted work. “If you find a woman who
is willing to marry you, let me know, and I’ll furnish
the marriage license&mdash;it won’t cost you a cent!”</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh!” Tick grinned. “Dat ’ll he’p
me a heap!”</p>

<p>Tick passed out of the bank and stood on the
street in front of the big plateglass window. He
took off his battered wool hat and scratched his
woolly head in real perplexity. Certainly, Marse
Tom had assigned him a tremendous task.</p>

<p>The world was full of marriageable colored women.</p>

<p>What woman should he ask?</p>

<p>He looked up and down the street with an appraising
eye. He could see ten women; some were fat
and some were lean, some were kind and some were
mean&mdash;what kind should he choose?</p>

<p>“Dat white man shore is wropped up my kinky
hair with a strong string,” he sighed as he mopped
the sweat from his face. “I b’lieve I’ll go ax a few
advices outen Skeeter Butts.”</p>


<h3>II<br />

SKEETER HELPS</h3>

<p>No one knows how Skeeter Butts got his reputation
among the members of his race as the possessor
of supernal wisdom. Nevertheless, in every emergency
it was their custom to ask Skeeter Butts, and
Skeeter was always there with the good advice.</p>

<p>Inexpert physicians frequently say to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
patients, “I’ll try this medicine, and if it don’t do
the work, I’ll change to something else.” Skeeter
followed the same method with his advice. With the
inexpert physician, too, often one medicine calls for
another; always with Skeeter, one suggestion led to
another; and the reason with both was the same&mdash;because
dangerous complications “set up.”</p>

<p>On matrimonial matters, Skeeter was supposed
to be extremely wise.</p>

<p>He had courted every woman in Tickfall and its
environs without actually committing matrimony.
His experiences had been many and varied, and
highly educational. So when Tick Hush appeared
in the Hen-Scratch saloon with a look of perplexed
melancholy upon his brown face, Skeeter at once
heated up his mental incubator to hatch out a few
rare thoughts.</p>

<p>“Dis here is a awful mess, Skeeter,” Tick began as
he held an ill-smelling perique stogie between his
stiff and trembling lips. “Marse Tom Gaitskill is
shore kotch my tail in a cuttin’-box.”</p>

<p>“How come?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“He offered me a job on de pest-house plantation
pervidin’ only but dat I gits married inside two
weeks.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s easy,” Skeeter grinned. “Lady folks is
crazy ’bout steppin’ off, an’ anybody kin git married.”</p>

<p>“How is dat did?” Tick asked.</p>

<p>“At de fust off-startin’, you seleck a woman whut
you wants to marry,” Skeeter suggested.</p>

<p>“Dat gits me in a jam right now,” Tick mourned.
“I’s powerful fondish on two nigger women.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” Skeeter grunted. “Dat looks like
cormpilations mought set up an’ us ’ll hab plenty
doin’s. Name de femaleses!”</p>

<p>“Limit Lark an’ Vakey Vapp,” Tick told him.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” Skeeter sighed. “Why cain’t you rattle
de bones, or cut cyards, or flop up a jitney, an’ decide
which am de whicher?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t pious,” Tick replied.</p>

<p>“You needn’t let dat pester you,” Skeeter cackled.
“Ary one of dem womens will make you lose yo’
religium powerful soon atter you marries ’em.”</p>

<p>“Cain’t you think up no highbrow way of deecidin’?”
Tick inquired.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter snapped. “But I don’t
think brains he’ps a man whut’s got his mind sot on
mettermony. Look at me&mdash;I’s a smart, up-to-date,
new-issue nigger&mdash;an’ I cain’t git married to nothin’!
Brains don’t git me even a two-times, secont-han’,
hand-me-down widder!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s because you is too choosey,” Tick grinned.</p>

<p>“Mebbe so,” Skeeter replied, as he applied his
mind to the problem before him. At last he suggested:</p>

<p>“How would it suit to write a letter to one of dem
niggers an’ ax her to marry you?”</p>

<p>“Dat don’t he’p me,” Tick explained. “Ef I
knowed which one to write to fust, I’d know which
one to ax fust&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I sees,” Skeeter interrupted. “You likes ’em
bofe alike, each one as much as de yuther. Well&mdash;whichsomever
one you take, you’ll wish to Gawd
you’d tuck de yuther one&mdash;lemme think!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>Skeeter lighted a cigarette and rubbed his nervous
hands over his closely cropped head. Then he jumped
to his feet with a yelp.</p>

<p>“I got it, Ticky!” he squealed. “Dis here is a
histidious notion&mdash;listen. You an’ me will write
a letter to bofe dem nigger womens. Den we’ll git a
nigger whut cain’t read ner write to pick out one of
dem letters outen a hat. De letter whut de igernunt
coon picks out is de one to be sont.”</p>

<p>“Listen to dat!” Tick Hush applauded. “Dat
sounds real cute. Git some paper an’ a writin’ pencil!”</p>

<p>Skeeter found two soiled envelopes, a writing-pad
and the stub of a pencil. Sitting down at a table,
he arranged them carefully, and said:</p>

<p>“You do de heavy thinkin’, Ticky, while I writes!”</p>

<p>Tick Hush rose to his feet and began a nervous
pacing up and down beside the table. He cleared
his throat, wiped the sweat from his face, fanned
himself with his hat, took off one brogan shoe and
shook the gravel out of it.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts sat and waited.</p>

<p>At length, Tick straightened up, breathed like a
husky bellows, and began:</p>

<p>“Dear Limit&mdash;” Then he broke off to ask:
“How’m I gittin’ along so fur, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fine start-off,” Skeeter assured him. “I
think she’ll kotch on to dat easy.”</p>

<p>“Say, ’I wants to git married right away’&mdash;hold
on, Skeeter!” Tick exclaimed in a sudden panic.
“Don’t be so peart ’bout writin’ how soon&mdash;tell her
atter while, befo’ long, when I kin git aroun’ to it,
when de craps is all in, or somepin like dat.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter retorted as he began to write.
“Tell her de real facks: ‘I wants to git married in
de nex’ ten days.’”</p>

<p>“O Lawdy,” Tick sighed. “Dat sounds powerful
early to me!”</p>

<p>“Go on!” Skeeter snapped.</p>

<p>“Say, ‘I hopes&mdash;I hopes&mdash;I hopes&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” Skeeter snapped. “You sound like a
danged ole donkey brayin’&mdash;you don’t hope nothin’!
Tell on!”</p>

<p>“Say, ‘Me an’ Skeeter&mdash;us thinks you-all oughter
marry us’!” Tick Hush dictated.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts laid aside his pencil and leaned back,
glaring at Tick with mingled pity and contempt.</p>

<p>“You is de worst igermus I knows of, Ticky Hush!”
he squealed. “Ef you an’ me wus to swap heads,
I’d die a durn fool! Stop talkin’ wid yo’ mouth an’
think!”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Tick Hush took a big breath
and a tidal wave of dictation splashed all around the
head of Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>“Say, ‘Will you marry me real soon?’ Say, ‘I
got a job on Marse Tom Gaitskill’s pest-house farm.’
Say, ‘I’ll take you out to see de place.’ Say, ‘We
lives togedder&mdash;plenty money, plenty eats. Answer
prompt! Yours&mdash;yo’ husbunt&mdash;yo&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter interrupted. “You don’t want
no answer through de mail-box&mdash;tell her to meet
you somewhar to-morrer night, ef she is willin’ to
take you on!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Tick agreed. Then he dictated:
“Say, ‘Answer prompt. Ef you is willin’, meet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
me to-morrer night behime de Shoofly church under
dat big sycamo’ tree. Yours truly Tick
Hush.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de way to talk it,” Skeeter applauded.
“Ef you wants a hoe-cake, reach out yo’ hand fer it.
Now wait a minute till I copy dis same letter, because
we got to hab two.”</p>

<p>When Skeeter had made the copy, he addressed
the two envelopes and slipped one message into each,
being extremely careful not to get the letters mixed
and put them in the wrong envelopes.</p>

<p>“Now, Skeeter,” Ticky asked, “who we gwine git
to pick out dis letter?”</p>

<p>“Little Bit cain’t read nothin’,” Skeeter suggested.</p>

<p>“Let him pick,” Tick agreed.</p>

<p>In answer to Skeeter’s call, a diminutive, bullet-headed
boy came from the rear room and picked up a
white envelope.</p>

<p>“Dat’s all, Little Bit!” Skeeter told him. “You
git!”</p>

<p>With the nervous solemnity of a man who was
determining the destiny of two lives, Skeeter turned
the envelope so he could see the address.</p>

<p>“It’s de letter to Limit Lark,” he almost whispered.</p>

<p>Tick Hush sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“Dat’s fine, Skeeter,” he said in a low voice. “I
sorter hoped it’d be Limit Lark, an’ I’d be plum’
happy ef she takes me&mdash;only but now I kinder wish
de yuther woman hadn’t drawed no blank.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe Limit won’t take you an’ dat ’ll gib you a
shot at de yuther gal,” Skeeter said hopefully.
“Lemme see. Limit wucks fer Judge Lanark. I’ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
write his name on one corner of dis, an’ dey ’ll put
de letter in de judge’s box.”</p>

<p>Skeeter stamped the envelope and called Little
Bit.</p>

<p>“Take dis right straight to de post-office, boy,”
he commanded.</p>

<p>“Much obleeged, Skeeter,” Tick said as he started
out. “Dat he’ps a mighty load offen my mind.”</p>

<p>When Tick Hush had gone, Skeeter stood fumbling
with the letter addressed to Vakey Vapp. He
placed a stamp upon it. Then a slow grin spread
over his face.</p>

<p>“It’s a plum’ pity dat Vakey Vapp don’t git no
letter,” he murmured. “I’s gwine down an’ mail
dis letter to her as soon as Little Bit gits back. Bofe
dem womans cain’t want Tick, an’ ’twon’t do no
harm. Mebbe it’ll do a large amount of great
good.”</p>


<h3>III<br />

SAFETY FIRST</h3>

<p>On his way to keep his engagement with Limit
Lark under the tree behind the Shoofly church, Tick
Hush had to pass the Hen-Scratch saloon. When he
reached the door he walked in.</p>

<p>“I helt up a minute fer a few last advices, Skeeter,”
he said nervously as he fumbled with his hat and
panted like a tired dog.</p>

<p>“Whut ails you now?” Skeeter demanded.</p>

<p>“Ef dat woman meets me under dat tree, whut
muss I say to her?” Tick inquired.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>“Ax her did she git yo’ letter,” Skeeter suggested.</p>

<p>“She won’t be dar ef she don’t git de letter,” Tick
protested.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter agreed, “but dat will make
talk an’ it’s a good way to begin.”</p>

<p>“Whut muss I say atter dat?” Tick asked helplessly.</p>

<p>“Ax her will she marry you,” Skeeter said.</p>

<p>“Ef she say she will, whut muss I do next?” Tick
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Grab her!” Skeeter cackled. “Swing onto her
like a cockle-bur to a woolly dawg’s y-ear!”</p>

<p>“Dat sounds easy!” Tick remarked, in a tone
which indicated that he considered the task attended
by both difficulty and danger. “I shore hopes I
don’t make no miscue!”</p>

<p>“You cain’t make no mistake,” Skeeter grinned.
“Womens likes to be hugged. I knows&mdash;I done
tried it a millyum times. Dat’s yo’ one safe bet!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Tick remarked in a tone indicating
that it was all wrong, and he rose reluctantly to his
feet. “I’ll try to make de riffle&mdash;but you listen out,
Skeeter! Ef you hear any real loud hollerin’ up de
Shoofly way, you’ll know it’s me! I got a hunch dat
de grabbin’ will be on de yuther foot&mdash;dat nigger
woman is gwine grab me!”</p>

<p>“Dat’ll be best of all,” Skeeter said, with a knowing
grin. “Ef she do de grabbin’, dat means you is
shore kotch&mdash;pervidin’ she don’t bite an’ scratch at
de same time.”</p>

<p>Tick slowly retreated from the room, and Skeeter
promptly reached for his own hat and started in the
same direction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>“Dat po’ fool nigger mought need a little back-up-ance,”
said Skeeter, grinning to himself.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the Shoofly church Tick Hush
waited, his anxious eyes fixed upon a bench under a
sycamore tree where he was to meet and make the
final matrimonial arrangements with Limit Lark.</p>

<p>Sometimes there comes out of the swamp into Tickfall
a negro so simple that his life has consisted of
eating, sleeping, and working. Having lived far
from civilization, his innocence and ignorance are
amazing. He is a joy to the planter, for he works
hard and does just as he is told to do. Coming into
contact with the negro social life of Tickfall, he is also
a joy to his colored friends&mdash;he contributes so largely
to the funny side of life.</p>

<p>Skeeter knew that Tick Hush was sure to contribute
much to the gaiety of the negro inhabitants
of Tickfall, and he had already tipped off his friends
to be ready to help him when he needed them.</p>

<p>So Tick waited at the church, peering across the
yard in the dim light of a young moon, feeling more
nervous and panicky as the moments passed, repeating
with dry lips the instructions of Skeeter Butts:</p>

<p>“Ax her did she git de letter&mdash;ax her to marry me&mdash;grab
her!”</p>

<p>Then a sudden weakness overcame him and he sat
down upon the ground so forcibly that he nearly
jarred his head loose from the rest of his anatomy.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” he murmured.</p>

<p>A woman dressed in white had moved quickly
across the churchyard and had seated herself upon the
bench under the sycamore tree. Tick experienced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
about the same sensation that might come to a war
spy backed up against a church wall and facing a
firing squad. Tick knew he was facing his fate.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m got to make de riffle,” he sighed as he
started slowly across the churchyard.</p>

<p>The woman saw him and stood up.</p>

<p>“Hello, Limit!” Tick began. “Did you git my
letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” the girl giggled.</p>

<p>She was a tall, neatly dressed woman, with typical
African features and skin as black as coal. In the
dim moonlight she began to look good to the embarrassed
Tick Hush.</p>

<p>Tick felt his courage oozing away, so he began to
speak in a loud voice:</p>

<p>“Is you gwine marry me?” he howled.</p>

<p>“Hush!” Limit whispered. “Some nigger woman
is comin’ dis way&mdash;she mought hear us!”</p>

<p>The two sat down on the bench and waited.</p>

<p>The second woman came up confidently, jauntily.</p>

<p>She was a square-headed, woolly-haired, pout-lipped
negro, with a short temper and a long tongue.</p>

<p>It was Vakey Vapp.</p>

<p>Tick Hush gazed at her in horror. Already he
could hear himself squalling to Skeeter Butts to come
and rescue him from the wrath of these two women.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ticky,” Vakey said easily. “I got yo’
letter all right an’ I got here as quick as I could.
Dat Gaitskill plantation looks good to me. I favors
ownin’ it right now!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, cullud folks!” Tick begged. “Don’t
shove me along so peart. You got to start me slow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
an’ gimme time. S’pose you-alls sets here a minute
an’ converse yo’se’ves, an’ lemme go git Skeeter
Butts.”</p>

<p>“Whut you need wid Skeeter?” Limit Lark inquired.</p>

<p>“Eh&mdash;uh&mdash;oh, Lawdy, I needs him bad&mdash;Skeeter’s
pretty handy to hab aroun’. I needs him fer comp’ny&mdash;social
puppuses&mdash;gosh!”</p>

<p>“Whut’s pesterin’ yo’ mind, Tick?” Vakey snapped.
“You ain’t actin’ plum honest about somepin!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m&mdash;dat’s a fack&mdash;er&mdash;I speck I better git
gwine!” Tick moaned.</p>

<p>“Not yit, Ticky!” Limit Lark said sharply. “I
done walked pretty fur to dis place an’ I wants my
permittune to marry you right now. Is you gwine
hitch up wid me?”</p>

<p>“Honey,” Tick said desperately, “I don’t like to
say nothin’ ’bout dat befo’ comp’ny&mdash;less git off
alone by ourse’ves fust!”</p>

<p>“How’s dat?” Vakey snapped. “Whut you
sayin’, Ticky? Is you figgerin’ on marryin’ dis here
Limit nigger?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” Tick began, “I ain’t really especkin’
to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Whut you say, nigger man?” Limit howled,
laying a firm and competent hand upon Tick’s coat
collar. “Talk straight, Ticky! An’ don’t you fergit
dat I always totes a mighty hard fist fer social
pupposes!”</p>

<p>She thrust a big clenched hand under Tick’s nose,
and Tick whistled through his nostrils like a mustang
smelling a bear.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>“I totes a big gun fer social pupposes!” Vakey
Vapp announced in a raucous voice as she thrust
her right hand into the folds of her ragged dress.</p>

<p>Then Tick squalled and bolted. But he did not
get very far. Limit and Vakey pooled their interests.
They laid hold upon the struggling colored man,
fought with him across the yard, and backed him
up against the church, a terrified chunk of cringing
flesh.</p>

<p>“Now, Ticky,” Vakey proclaimed as she flourished
her big pistol before Tick’s frightened face, “me an’
Limit is gwine straighten you out flat. You cain’t
fool no ole ginny-hens like us&mdash;so you better tell de
Gawd’s truth.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Tick stuttered.</p>

<p>“Did you write dis letter to me?” Vakey howled,
shaking a soiled envelope under Tick’s nose.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Tick stuttered.</p>

<p>“Did you write dis here letter to me?” Limit
whooped, waving another soiled envelope before his
face.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Tick chattered.</p>

<p>“How come?” the two whooped in irate tones.</p>

<p>Vakey’s right hand was waving a pistol with what
seemed to Tick to be extreme carelessness. He was
sure he was going to be killed, and he lifted his terrified
eyes for one startled look at the white tombstones
which stood in the graveyard beside the church.</p>

<p>Then the only inspiration he had ever had came
to him in a flash.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” he whooped, and his face and voice
were certainly expressive of terror, an alarm he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
been feeling for ten minutes. “My Gawd! Look
over yander at that graveyard!”</p>

<p>The two women turned to look with startled
suddenness.</p>

<p>It was quite an artful ruse for a slow wit like Tick
Hush. He had not seen a thing, but as the women
turned Tick took the first step in his getaway.</p>

<p>Then a fortuitous circumstance contributed to
Tick’s escape.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts had concealed himself on the far
side of the churchyard near to the cemetery fence in
order to command a large view of the locality near
the sycamore tree where Tick was to meet the two
women.</p>

<p>Skeeter was afraid of that graveyard. He did not
like to lie down so near to it. For ten minutes the cold
shivers had been chasing up and down his spine, and he
earnestly desired to be anywhere but where he was.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard Tick’s horrified exclamation
he felt like he must leave the vicinity of the burying-ground
at once. He arose to depart, and thus it
happened that it was Skeeter dressed in a ghostly
white duck suit, that the two negro women saw!</p>

<p>Vakey Vapp raised the pistol which she kept for
social purposes and fired five shots in rapid succession
at Skeeter Butts. For the first time in his adventurous
life Skeeter went through a graveyard at night
alone!</p>

<p>Tick Hush went to Tickfall, running about one
hundred yards in advance of the two women, and the
trio made as much noise as a calliope played by a
maniac with a hundred fingers!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>


<h3>IV<br />

THE COLONEL ISSUES ORDERS</h3>

<p>In every storm Tick Hush always anchored himself
to a white man. So, on this occasion, he did not
stop running until he stood gasping for breath on
Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s lawn.</p>

<p>Tick heard voices coming from the porch, and he
knew better than to rush precipitately into the presence
of guests. He began to listen, and after a while
he broke into a grin.</p>

<p>“Dem white men is feelin’ good. Dey’s jes’ explodin’
jokes to each yuther. I’s gwine bust in an’
explode my tale of trouble.”</p>

<p>He walked closer to the porch and stood where the
pale moonlight fell upon him.</p>

<p>“Is dat Marse Tom Gaitskill’s voice I hears?” he
asked in a timid tone.</p>

<p>“Yes. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, I’s in powerful deep trouble,” Tick
sighed as he came up to the porch steps. “Yes, suh,
trouble is done slopped my trough good.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;tell us about it,” Gaitskill said impatiently.
“Spill it!”</p>

<p>“You tole me I had to git married, Marse Tom,”
Tick began. “I fanciated two nigger womens pretty
good, so I writ a letter to bofe of ’em an’ axed ’em to
marry me. Bofe of ’em tuck me up on dat.”</p>

<p>“That ought to make you feel happy,” Gaitskill
chuckled.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, it worries me in my mind. You see,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
bofe dem niggers met me under a sycamo’ tree, an’ one
of ’em bragged her brags dat she toted a pistol reg’lar,
an’ dey backed me up ag’in’ de chu’ch to pussuade me,
an’&mdash;an’ a ha’nt come outen de graveyard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tick stopped and chuckled.</p>

<p>“That ha’nt shore done me a good favor. I’d ’a’
been a ha’nt myse’f by now ef he hadn’t showed up
so handy.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” Gaitskill laughed.</p>

<p>“I lef’ dem two nigger womens wid him,” Tick
snickered. “Dat ha’nt never could ’a’ kep’ up wid
me&mdash;he didn’t had no use fer me nohow&mdash;an’ I didn’t
need him&mdash;so I let de lady folks hab him all to deirse’ves.”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard this negro’s testimony, judge.
What’s your verdict?” Gaitskill asked smilingly of
Judge Henry Lanark, who sat beside him on the
porch.</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord, I’m no lunacy jury,” Lanark
laughed. Then he asked: “Was one of those women
named Limit, Tick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh.”</p>

<p>“I have a little corroborating testimony to offer,”
Judge Lanark remarked to Gaitskill. “I got a letter
in my post-office box to-day addressed to Limit Lark,
my cook. I presume Tick picked her for matrimonial
honors.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s her,” Tick chuckled.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do about it, Tick?”
Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p>“I dunno, Marse Tom. I jes’ come to git a view
from you ’bout dat.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>“What do you think those two women will do to
you?” Gaitskill queried.</p>

<p>“Kill me dead,” Tick answered simply.</p>

<p>“In that case, I presume you do not care to consider
a matrimonial alliance with either,” Gaitskill grinned.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, nothin’ like dat.”</p>

<p>“What do you think those two women will do to
each other when they compare the contents of those
two letters?” Gaitskill asked next.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows,” Tick sighed.</p>

<p>“It would be wise to recover those letters, if possible,”
Judge Lanark suggested.</p>

<p>“I kin git ’em all right,” Tick said. “Bofe letters
is layin’ on de groun’ close to de Shoofly chu’ch whar
dey dropped ’em down when dey seed de ha’nt.”</p>

<p>“Go get them at once!” Lanark commanded.</p>

<p>“I’ll git ’em in de mawnin’, jedge,” Tick replied.
“Nobody ain’t gwine pick ’em up to-night&mdash;not no
niggers&mdash;dey ain’t!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there some other woman you could fall in
love with?” Gaitskill wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I ’speck so, boss.”</p>

<p>“I advise you to choose a third party and marry
her,” Gaitskill said.</p>

<p>“I’s kinder squeamish ’bout dat, kunnel,” Tick
said earnestly. “You see, dis am de fustest time I is
ever messed wid mattermony, an’ I ain’t real shore
of my foot-holt.”</p>

<p>“You have messed it pretty well, so far,” Gaitskill
laughed. “Of course, if you don’t want to marry, I
think I can find some other man to put on my plantation
as tenant&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“Naw, suh, kunnel,” Tick interrupted with emphasis.
“I’s gwine git dat job ef I’s got to mess up
wid all de mattermony ladies in dis town. I needs
dat job.”</p>

<p>“Go as far as you like,” Gaitskill smiled. “You
can’t make me mad. If you get into trouble I’ll
help you all I can, and I am sure the judge will give
you the benefit of his legal knowledge and experience.”</p>

<p>“Will you-alls really he’p me, Marse Tom?” Tick
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Gaitskill did not know that his jesting words were
being taken seriously. So his answer to Tick’s eager
question was unfortunate. It had the effect of turning
Tick loose on the community, feeling that he
could do anything with impunity because the colonel
and the judge were with him.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Gaitskill said. “We’ll be glad to
help you.”</p>

<p>“Could you begin he’pin’ by loantin’ me five
dollars?” Tick asked diffidently.</p>

<p>“Give it to him!” Lanark exploded. “War munitions&mdash;campaign
expenses!”</p>

<p>Tick turned away with the money in his pocket
and exultation in his heart. With two great men to
back his enterprises, he was sure he could accomplish
great things. Whatever the risks, he would be perfectly
safe. Even if he got into jail, the judge would
help him out again.</p>

<p>“I’ll mess wid mattermony, all right!” he chuckled.
“It’s de kunnel’s awders!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>


<h3>V<br />

SKEETER HELPS SOME MORE</h3>

<p>Early the next morning Tick Hush appeared at
the Hen-Scratch saloon and found Skeeter Butts
nursing a grouch and sundry bruises, all of which he
had received in his wild flight through the graveyard.</p>

<p>“Whut you showin’ up here fer?” Skeeter snarled.</p>

<p>“Troubles,” Tick told him.</p>

<p>“I’m got ’em of my own,” Skeeter snapped.
“Don’t pesticate me.”</p>

<p>“You’s de only good-advicin’ nigger in Tickfall,
Skeeter,” Tick said earnestly. “Ef a feller cain’t
ax you ’terrogations, he mought as well go out an’
suicide hisse’f!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it de trufe!” Skeeter grinned, greatly mollified
by this praise. “Whut ails you now?”</p>

<p>“I had a leetle talk wid Limit an’ Vakey las’ night,
an’ I done decided to cut ’em bofe out. Dey argufies
pretty sharp yistiddy evenin’. One of ’em applied
at me wid a big gun&mdash;I don’t favor dat kind of
nigger.”</p>

<p>“Ef you is done got dat wise, you don’t need no
more advices,” Skeeter grinned. “Eve’y nigger
woman argufies wid guns an’ razors an’ skillets, an’
truck like dat. Of co’se, ef you cuts all dat out, dat
means you ain’t gwine hitch double wid nobody.”</p>

<p>“But I got to marry!” Tick exclaimed. “Marse
Tom specify&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right!” Skeeter interrupted tartly. “Who
am de choosen woman now?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>“Well, suh, I cogitate dat Button Hook is de right
kind of meekified woman fer me to take on,” Tick
declared. “Button is kinder sweet an’ soft-spoke.”</p>

<p>“I fell in love wid a woman like dat wunst,” Skeeter
grinned. “Us wus about to git married. I axed her
whut she done fer a livin’ so she could suppote me
like I wus raised&mdash;an’ she said she an’ her pap kotch
snakes in de swamp an’ sold ’em to show folks in a
circus. De nex’ time I seed her she had a lapful of
rattlesnakes&mdash;dat wus de last time I looked at her,
too!”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Tick murmured.</p>

<p>“You cain’t tell nothin’ ’bout pickin’ ’em,” Skeeter
continued. “Dey’s wuss’n race-hosses. You bet
yo’ money an’ you lose it on a hoss; you bet yo’ money
an’ you lose it on a woman; an’ on top of dat you is
wished yo’se’f a live job, losin’ money all de time.”</p>

<p>“Now, ’bout dis Button Hook&mdash;” Tick began.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter Butts interrupted. “She’ll
throw de hook inter you all right. You go nibblin’
aroun’ dat hook an’ you’s already a sucker on a string&mdash;powerful
soon you’ll be crackin’ an’ fryin’ in a skillet.
Suttinly&mdash;go ahead! Whut wus you gwine to
say?”</p>

<p>“I wus fixin’ to remark dat she comes in pretty
handy right now. Dat’s my onlies’ chance. Marse
Tom specify fer me to seleck a third party. De kunnel
an’ Judge Lanark gib me a few advices las’ night,
an’ bofe dem white mens said dey would stan’ by me.”</p>

<p>Skeeter sat up with a sudden and great interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>“Why’n’t you tell me dat Kunnel Gaitskill an’
Jedge Lanark wus backin’ you in dis race? Dat

makes it plum diffunt. I jines in wid de white folks,
too.”</p>

<p>“Dat happifies me consid’able, Skeeter,” Tick
exclaimed with a wide grin. “Whut is our fust
move-up?”</p>

<p>“We mought write a letter to Button&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Tick exploded. “Jedge Lanark say
dat govermint wus agin love letters&mdash;dey gits you in
trouble wid de cotehouse. Dem two niggers drapped
dem letters on de groun’ las’ night, an’ I foun’ ’em
close to de Shoofly chu’ch dis mawnin’. I got ’em in
de inside coat-pocket right now, next to my heart.”</p>

<p>“Gib ’em to me&mdash;” Skeeter said eagerly.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. I’ll tote ’em in my own coat-pocket,”
Tick snarled. “I let you keep one yistiddy an’ it
got away from you! Go on wid dem Button advices!”</p>

<p>“You mought send Button a box of candy, den
wait a day or two an’ go out dar an’ talk sweet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Twon’t do, Skeeter. Candy costs money; excusin’
dat, I got to hurry along wid dis mattermony&mdash;I
needs somepin hasty.”</p>

<p>“Run in dar some night an’ kidnap her up!”
Skeeter suggested.</p>

<p>“Say, Skeeter,” Tick asked with a wide grin, “did
you ever hear a skeart nigger woman holler?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeedy,” the little barkeeper snickered.
“I heerd two las’ night. Steamboat whistles am jes’
little wheezes when a nigger woman begins to squall.”</p>

<p>“No nigger-stealin’ fer me,” Tick announced with
finality.</p>

<p>Skeeter lighted a cigarette and began to ponder.</p>

<p>Give Skeeter Butts the number two, and his active
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
brain could always make four or forty-four by the
simple process of multiplying. From the little Tick
Hush had said, Skeeter multiplied and got this result:
Gaitskill and Lanark had selected Button Hook as a
suitable wife for Tick Hush; the white folks would be
greatly disappointed if Tick did not marry her; any
man who helped Tick get married to the woman of
their choice would be in good favor with those two
influential white men.</p>

<p>Reasoning thus, Skeeter determined to invent a
plan which would insure a hasty marriage between
Tick and Button, and he resolved at the same time to
be the best man at their wedding. Most people, facing
this situation, would have told Tick to go to Button
Hook and ask her to marry him, pressing his suit
with ardor, eloquence, and affection until the lady
consented. But Skeeter never could think of the
obvious thing.</p>

<p>There was a long silence in the Hen-Scratch saloon,
interrupted only by the scratching of matches and the
jiggering of feet.</p>

<p>At length Skeeter stood up with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Gee,” he howled. “My brains shore is actin’
like gourd-seeds to-day&mdash;I wonder how I never thunk
of dat at fust!”</p>

<p>“Don’t bust no jokes on me, Skeeter,” Tick warned
him. “Dis here is solemn bizzness, an’ de white folks
don’t take no nigger foolishness.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Tick!” Skeeter commanded. “Whut
you needs is a few lessons in coteship an’ marriage.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Tick agreed. “I needs a shawt
cut-off.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>“Dar’s a actor-woman in dis town named Dazzle
Zenor. She plays love parts in shows. I acted wid
her once&mdash;we wus stunt-dancers fer de Nigger Uplift
dat time I got shotted accidental.”</p>

<p>“Dat don’t he’p me none&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” Skeeter snapped. “You listen to
me talk! Fools like you gimme a pain. Now, dis
here Dazzle gal, she knows all about how to make
love an’ how to cote a gal an’ how to ax to git married
because she studies dat fer de stage.”</p>

<p>“I sees de light,” Tick grinned.</p>

<p>“Now, de dog’s tail wags dis way,” Skeeter said,
warming up to his great idea. “You wants to go to
Dazzle Zenor an’ ax her to gib you a few cheap lessons
on how to make love an’ git married quick.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s whut I needs!” Tick agreed hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Is you got any money on yer?” Skeeter demanded.</p>

<p>“De kunnel gib me five dollars las’ night,” Tick
replied reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a plenty,” Skeeter told him. “Dazzle will
gib you five dollars’ wuth of lessons, an’ den you kin
git married jes’ like drappin’ a hat.”</p>

<p>“Whar do Dazzle stay at?”</p>

<p>“She stays at Ginny Babe Chew’s house.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind gwine wid me, Skeeter?” Tick
inquired. “I needs somebody to he’p me make de
fust arrangements.”</p>

<p>“I never had no yuther idear!” Skeeter howled.
“Ain’t dis here my plan? I don’t let no rooster like
you crow up my big idears&mdash;I sees ’em through.”</p>

<p>He reached for his hat, and Tick stood up to go
with him. Then he whooped:

<p>“Oh, Little Bit! You take keer dis saloom till I
gits back!”</p>


<h3>VI<br />

LOVE LESSONS</h3>

<p>“You do de talkin’ fer me, Skeeter,” Tick begged as
they entered Ginny Babe Chew’s yard. “I ain’t
never got into no mess like dis befo’, an’ I cain’t
tongue it out as free as you kin.”</p>

<p>“Dar she am,” Skeeter exclaimed, as he pointed to
a young colored woman sitting on a bench under a
pecan tree at the side of the house. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Dazzle Zenor was certainly the sort of woman a
colored man would naturally select to teach him the
art of love. She was slim and graceful, neat as a new
pin and beautifully dressed; she had fine Moorish
features, and smiled with beautiful teeth and did
flattering things with her eyes, for Dazzle was a real
actress.</p>

<p>“Dis here cullud gen’leman is got de love-bug,
Dazzle,” Skeeter explained. “He wants to cote a
gal so dat he kin marry her real prompt, an’ he don’t
know how it is did. I tole him you wus a female
actor an’ you could teach him how to love wid one
lesson.”</p>

<p>Then Skeeter executed an elaborate wink.</p>

<p>“How much kin you pay?” Dazzle asked, looking
at Tick.</p>

<p>“How much do it cost?” Tick asked cautiously.</p>

<p>“How many money is you got?” Dazzle inquired.</p>

<p>Tick handed her a five-dollar bill.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s a plenty,” Dazzle laughed as she folded the
bill and slipped it into the palm of her kid glove.
Then she looked Tick over as if he were a horse she
was thinking of buying. After a while she asked:</p>

<p>“Whut does you know about makin’ love to a
woman, Tick?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” Tick answered modestly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you never kissed no womens?” Dazzle
asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“Well, what happened?”</p>

<p>“Dey batted me over de head wid de fust thing
whut come handy. De las’ one broke a puffeckly
good settin’-chair on my noodle.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you never hugged no womens?” Dazzle
asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t perzackly call it huggin’,” Tick explained.
“Quick as I grab ’em, dey squall an’ fight an’ ack like
dey wus ag’in it.”</p>

<p>Dazzle turned to Skeeter with an amazed question:</p>

<p>“Did you ever see de beat?”</p>

<p>Skeeter was evidently stricken dumb before such
complete inexperience and such colossal ignorance.</p>

<p>Tick wadded his hat into a tight ball and waited
while Dazzle thought out a course of instruction.</p>

<p>“All right, Ticky,” she said, at last. “I’ll set here
on dis bench an’ you come a-courtin’ me. Do de
very best you knows how, an’ Skeeter kin stan’ off on
one side an’ suggest improvements on de lesson.”</p>

<p>Dazzle sat down and waited.</p>

<p>Tick fumbled with his hat, and breathed like a
choking horse.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>Skeeter stood like a motion-picture director looking
at the actors in this drama of love.</p>

<p>“Git busy!” Skeeter howled.</p>

<p>“Whu&mdash;whut muss I do fust?” Tick growled.</p>

<p>“Kiss her&mdash;kiss her!” Skeeter ordered.</p>

<p>Tick sat down beside Dazzle, and started to kiss
her. Then he backed away, and took up his position
at the far end of the bench, looking at her with extreme
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Aw, shuckins!” Skeeter howled. “You kissed
at dat purdy gal like a sick sheep lickin’ salt! Don’t
be skeart you’ll git too much&mdash;she ain’t p’ison&mdash;git
yo’ five dollar’s wuth!”</p>

<p>Tick Hush “sulled.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine take no mo’ lesson,” he declared.
“You-all is jes’ prankin’ wid me. I wants my five
dollars back.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin’, Ticky,” Dazzle laughed. “I
ain’t gwine git in de habit of givin’ money back&mdash;it’s
too expensive. Bless Gawd, I ain’t never gib none
back yit. Come on wid yo’ lessons!”</p>

<p>“I’s jes’ losin’ time an’ money monkeyin’ wid you-alls,”
Tick growled. “You niggers is flimflamuxed
me.”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter howled. “You’ll git yo’ money’s
wuth. Lemme take yo’ place an’ show you how it is
did!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t apply, Skeeter,” Dazzle grinned.
“I’s givin’ dese here lessons. I’ll let Tick set on de
bench an’ I’ll show him how it oughter be did. Set
down, Tick!”</p>

<p>Tick sat down on the bench with about as much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
eagerness as a condemned man takes his seat in the
electric chair. And he waited for what was to happen
with about the same feeling that a man awaits the
electric shock.</p>

<p>“Here’s de way to do de kissin’ ack,” Dazzle
exclaimed in her best stage voice.</p>

<p>She swept forward in her best stage manner and
threw her eager arms around&mdash;empty air.</p>

<p>Tick bolted.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts grabbed a tree, laid his head back
between his shoulder blades, opened his mouth to its
fullest extent, and laughed like a fool.</p>

<p>Tick got a Cherokee rosebush between himself and
the histrionic beauty and took a lesson in watchful
waiting.</p>

<p>“Ketch him, Dazzle,” Skeeter screamed. “Ketch
him&mdash;O my Lawd!”</p>

<p>His voice trailed off in demoniacal whoops of
laughter like a wind-broken calliope, and Dazzle sat
down with an astonishment which left her perfectly
helpless.</p>

<p>In all her earthly career, she had never before found
a man who bolted when she wanted to kiss him!</p>

<p>With a decisive gesture, she removed the five-dollar
bill from the palm of her glove, and stood up,
facing Tick Hush.</p>

<p>“Come here, Tick, an’ git dis money!” she commanded.</p>

<p>“No’m,” Tick chattered. “I wouldn’t come even
fer five dollars!”</p>

<p>“Come on! I won’t kiss you&mdash;I jes’ want to han’
dis change back&mdash;honest!” Dazzle urged.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>“Hang it on de rose bush an’ git back about fawty
feet!” Tick commanded. “I ain’t trustin’ nobody
no more!”</p>

<p>Dazzle solemnly laid the bill upon a branch of the
rose, piercing it with a thorn so that it would not fall
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Tick,” she said in a serious tone, “my advices to
you is dis: You buy a real nice present fer dat gal of
your’n wid dis money. Gib it to her an’ tell her you
wants to marry her, den ax her paw to throw you
down an hawg-tie you ontil she kin git her fust engagement
kiss. Good-by!”</p>

<p>Dazzle Zenor turned away from the two men, went
straight to her room, and sat down before a mirror.
For half an hour, she studied every feature of her
face with critical inspection. But her silent inquiry
was in vain. To the end of her life, she wondered
why Tick had bolted when she had tried to kiss him!</p>

<p>As for Tick, he edged around the rosebush until he
got within reaching distance of that five-dollar bill.
He grabbed it and ran down the street as if he were
chased by a dozen pretty women desirous of presenting
him with an affectionate osculation.</p>

<p>Skeeter’s maniacal laughter subsided to a hysterical
giggle, as he watched Tick’s precipitous flight.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” he snickered. “De kisser’s gone an’
pulled his freight to kiss her on some later date!”</p>

<p>Then Skeeter sat down on the bench where Tick had
received his first and last lesson in the art of love, and
smoked one cigarette after another, sighing frequently
and thinking hard. He decided that Tick had lost
the opportunity of a lifetime to be kissed by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
prettiest woman in the world, one who knew how to
do it. Skeeter wished that he had had Tick’s chance.</p>

<p>“Shuckins!” he said in deep disgust. “A nigger
like Tick don’t never know whut’s good fer him!”</p>


<h3>VII<br />

BUTTON HOOK</h3>

<p>Deeply embarrassed by his experience, and sorely
perplexed over his difficulties, Tick Hush wandered
down toward that portion of the town occupied by
the whites, and stopped short in his meditations before
a drug-store which carried a stock of cheap
jewelry. He held his retrieved five-dollar bill in
his sweating palm and looked into the dusty show-window.</p>

<p>“Dat nigger actor gimme one good tip,” he murmured.
“I’ll buy my gal a real nice present, and
take it to her when I git ready to express my bizzness.”</p>

<p>He entered the drug-store timidly and leaned
against a show-case.</p>

<p>“What you want, colored man?” the clerk asked.</p>

<p>“I wants a little gold fitten fer a cullud lady to
wear on her,” Tick grinned diffidently.</p>

<p>“Everything in this show-case comes up to your
specifications in one respect,” the clerk said flippantly.
“There’s mighty little gold about the stuff. What
do you fancy?”</p>

<p>“Dunno, suh. I wants a view from you on dat.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” the clerk said, as he lifted out a piece
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
of jewelry and held it up for inspection. “A wrist
watch&mdash;just the thing&mdash;all the women wear them and
every woman is crazy about them.”</p>

<p>“How much do dat’n cost?” Tick inquired.</p>

<p>“Four-ninety-eight&mdash;let you have it for five dollars,
cash!” the clerk responded.</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh. Dat’s about de size of my little
dab of money. Please wrop it up in a real nice box.”</p>

<p>The clerk polished the piece of jewelry, wrapped it
neatly, and Tick started for the home of Button Hook
with the package in his hip pocket.</p>

<p>Button lived on the edge of the negro settlement
known as Hell’s Half-Acre, and Tick had no trouble
learning whether or not she was at home, for he heard
her voice, as high and as strident as the call of the
katydid, singing a song which assured him:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“O love’s my meat, an’ love’s my drink, an’ love’s my
daily fare&mdash;an’ Love an’ me walks han’ in han’ when I
has a han’ to spare!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tick’s method of presenting her with the wristwatch
was unique. He walked into the yard and
knocked loudly upon the front door. Then he ran
down to the street, laid his package in a conspicuous
place on top of the gatepost, and hid behind a convenient
stump upon the other side of the road to
watch proceedings.</p>

<p>The girl came to the door and looked out. She
spied the package and ran down after it. She
unwrapped it, gave a squeal of delight, and ran back
into the house.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>“Dat made a fine hit!” Tick exclaimed, cutting
a caper behind the stump.</p>

<p>He waited about ten minutes, then announced to
himself:</p>

<p>“I reckin it’s ’bout time I wus gwine in an’ tellin’
her who sont her dat gift.”</p>

<p>He entered the yard and knocked loudly upon the
door. Button Hook responded and Tick entered the
house.</p>

<p>“Did you git a leetle somepin a while ago, Button?”
he began.</p>

<p>“Naw,” the girl responded.</p>

<p>“Didn’t nobody leave you nothin’ on dat gatepost
out dar?” Tick asked in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>“Naw!” the girl answered.</p>

<p>She sat before him quietly, a small, tan-colored
woman, with small eyes, small hands, and features as
dull and expressionless as the face of a rag doll.</p>

<p>“My gosh,” Tick howled. “Whut become of dat
leetle gold wrist-watch I lef’ on dat gatepost?”</p>

<p>“Did you leave one out dar?” Button asked
innocently.</p>

<p>“Suttinly!” Tick said. “An’ you got it, too. I
know, because I peeped at you from behime a stump.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Button snickered.</p>

<p>“Whar is it?” Tick demanded.</p>

<p>“It didn’t hab no name on it an’ maw claimed it
wus her’n,” she told him.</p>

<p>“Huh,” Tick grunted in despair. “Dat wus fer
you&mdash;it was my weddin’ present to you.”</p>

<p>“Yo’&mdash;which?” the girl inquired in a startled tone.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Tick plunged on. “You an’ me is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
gwine git married. It’s Marse Tom Gaitskill’s awders&mdash;de
Kunnel, an’ Jedge Henry Lanark, an’ Skeeter
Butts&mdash;dey all agrees dat it’s shore got to be.”</p>

<p>The girl took a breath of astonishment which
threatened to consume all the air in the room.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom says we kin live on de pest-house
plantation. Dem deaders buried aroun’ dar won’t
gib us no ketchin’ disease. We got a good cabin an’
plenty to eat, an’ I’ll make plenty dollars.”</p>

<p>Then while Button Hook still gasped for air, Tick
stood up. He assumed Dazzle Zenor’s best stage
manner, and swept down upon Button Hook to give
her an imitation of Dazzle Zenor’s best stage kiss.</p>

<p>And Button did just what Tick had done&mdash;she
bolted.</p>

<p>She ran out of the room and left Tick to embrace
the empty air.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Tick grunted. “Dazzle should had
gib me anodder lesson so I would know whut to do
now.”</p>

<p>The windows in the room were closed tight, and
Tick felt extremely warm. He tramped the floor for
a few minutes, then took off his coat and hung it
across the back of a chair.</p>

<p>“I reckin I better make myse’f at home an’ wait
till Buttons gits back,” he soliloquized. “I don’t
know whut else to do. Mebbe she’ll come back some
time to-day.”</p>

<p>In the rear of the house, Button’s father was lying
asleep on a pallet on the porch. He was an old man
with long woolly hair, and long cork-screw whiskers;
his feet were bare, and his body was clothed with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
pair of ragged pantaloons and a soiled, patched,
yellowish undershirt.</p>

<p>“Wake up, pap,” Button panted when she ran out
of the room where Tick had tried to kiss her. “I got
somepin to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Whut’s dat?” her parent inquired, rubbing his
hands over his face and head and rumpling his hair
and whiskers into a frightful disorder. “Whut you
want?”</p>

<p>“A nigger man named Tick Hush is asettin’ in de
front room an’ he wants to borrer yo’ shotgun,”
Button told him.</p>

<p>“Shore!” old Hook exclaimed. “I’ll loant Ticky
de gun!”</p>

<p>He hastily lifted the gun down from two nails
upon the kitchen wall, and in his frightful disarray,
he went prancing into the front sitting-room. When
he appeared in the doorway, Tick Hush looked up
and beheld a barefooted, shirtless old man, with disheveled
hair and beard, holding a double-barreled
shotgun, and Tick had just made an unsuccessful
attempt to kiss that old gentleman’s lovely daughter!</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Tick howled. “Somebody is got to
take my place right now&mdash;it’s vacant!”</p>

<p>He went through the nearest window without taking
the trouble to raise the sash. There was a crash
of glass, and Tick picked himself up from the ground
where he had fallen, and broke the world’s record for
a half-mile dash.</p>

<p>He staggered into the Hen-Scratch saloon in the
last stages of exhaustion and sank down weakly upon
a chair.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>Skeeter came and looked the fugitive over. His
clothes were torn and covered with dust, and his face
and head were bleeding from half a dozen slight cuts.</p>

<p>“Is you hurted, Ticky?” Skeeter asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I axed Button to marry me,” Tick panted. “I
ain’t come away from no place as fast sence dat bear
chased me through de swamp las’ year.”</p>

<p>“Did she take on much?” Skeeter snickered.</p>

<p>“Naw,” Tick growled. “Her ole pap chased me
wid a shotgun. I loped plum’ acrost deir chicken-yard
wid a winder sash hung aroun’ my neck like a
dawg-collar.”</p>

<p>Skeeter bean to laugh.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no use to cackle, Skeeter,” Tick exclaimed.
“I’s gwine up to Marse Tom Gaitskill’s an’ tell him
dat I won’t take charge of dat pest-house plantation
at no price. I ain’t gwine be pestered to death
messin’ wid mattermony no longer.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s too bad,” Skeeter said.</p>

<p>Then he stopped with mouth agape.</p>

<p>The door of the saloon opened, and Button Hook
was standing in the room.</p>

<p>Her afterthought had been better than her forethought.
She had considered Tick’s offer of marriage
as soon as her father had chased him off the
place, and had decided to take it. So now, she was
hunting for her fugitive lover to entice him to renew
his suit.</p>

<p>“Fer Heaven’s sake, Ticky,” she began, “whut
made you run off so soon?”</p>

<p>“I needed some place fer to git,” Ticky growled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
“Dat ole varmint wus fixin’ to shoot me wid dat
gun.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so!” Button exclaimed. “He jes’ wanted
to cornverse you a little about de pest-house plantation&mdash;an’
you busted a whole winder outen our
cabin.”</p>

<p>“I shore busted it,” Tick agreed. “I’s gwine bust
one eve’y time a nigger wants to cornverse me wid a
shotgun.”</p>

<p>“Dat wus jes’ a joke, Ticky,” Button smiled,
patting him on the shirt-sleeve where a slight cut
showed the red. “I was prankin’ wid you all de
time. Maw didn’t had dat watch; I had it hid behime
de big clock in de very room whar you wus
settin’ at.”</p>

<p>Button dropped her left hand down Tick’s arm
until it rested upon his wrist. Tick looked, and saw
his wrist watch clasped around her small brown arm.</p>

<p>“Did you really mean whut you wus sayin’ in my
house, Ticky?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Tick replied.</p>

<p>“I’m wid you in dat offer, Ticky,” Button said
easily. “I says&mdash;Yes!”</p>

<p>“Listen to dat word!” Skeeter Butts exploded.
“De arrangements is all sottled up&mdash;you’s got her,
Ticky!”</p>

<p>Tick looked like a man who had drawn a grand
prize in the lottery.</p>

<p>“Honey, you shore is lifted a weight offen my
mind,” he assured her.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine expeck you up at my house to-night,
Ticky,” Button told him as she started out. “You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
lef’ yo’ coat hangin’ on a chair in de front settin’-room
an’ you got to come an’ git it.”</p>

<p>A moment after she had passed out Skeeter exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Telephome Marse Tom Gaitskill, Ticky. Tell
him to git out dem pair of cotehouse licenses befo’
de clerk’s office shuts up. Hurry!”</p>


<h3>VIII<br />

“WHAT’S IN A NAME?”</h3>

<p>Colonel Tom Gaitskill left the bank and walked
across the street to the office of the clerk of the Third
District Court.</p>

<p>“I want a colored marriage license, Mack,” he
remarked as he leaned against the desk and began
the ceremonial process of lighting a big cigar.</p>

<p>The deputy clerk grinned and opened a big book.</p>

<p>“What’s the man’s name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Tick Hush.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the lady of color?” the clerk inquired, as
his pen scratched on the paper.</p>

<p>Gaitskill’s hand paused, holding a lighted match
about two inches from the end of his cigar. He held
it there until the flame scorched his fingers. He
dropped the match and sucked the blisters, uttering
sundry expletives as sulfurous as the head of the
match. Then he gave himself up to thought.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” he said. “Do you know I forgot to
ask that negro what woman he was going to marry?”</p>

<p>He struck another match and lighted his cigar.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
He puffed like a steamboat for a minute, and spoke
again:</p>

<p>“I was talking to Tick last night and he mentioned
two negro women, Limit and Vakey. Now I wonder
which one he decided to marry?”</p>

<p>“Which is the best cook?” the clerk grinned.</p>

<p>“Limit Lark, I presume,” the Colonel answered.
“Limit cooks for Judge Lanark&mdash;ah, that’s the one.
I remember now, because Judge Lanark was sitting
on the porch with me at the time and I
heard him complain that he was about to lose his
cook&mdash;make out the license for Tick Hush and Limit
Lark!”</p>

<p>The clerk quickly completed the document, collected
two dollars and fifty cents of the banker’s
money, and handed over the long envelope.</p>

<p>“How many of these licenses have you bought in
your life, Mr. Gaitskill?”</p>

<p>“Two barrels full,” Gaitskill chuckled. “It’s
a good investment. Courthouse marriages, as the
negroes call them, stick better, and the negroes seem
to get along with less fuss.”</p>

<p>Slipping the envelope in his pocket, he walked out.
When he reached his home about dark, he found Tick
Hush sitting under a tree waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Did you git dem pair of marriage license, Marse
Tom?” Tick asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Here is the document,” Gaitskill said, handing
it to the grinning negro.</p>

<p>Tick seized it with trembling fingers, opened it
hastily, then glared at it with popping eyeballs.</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy, Marse Tom!” he exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
“You done had dem license made out fer de wrong
gal.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s suttingly a miscue, kunnel. Dis
paper says dat I’s gwine marry Limit Lark, but de
real gal is Button Hook!”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” Gaitskill exclaimed disgustedly.
“I couldn’t remember what the woman’s name was.
I don’t think you ever mentioned Button Hook to
me. Give that paper back. I’ll have it changed.”</p>

<p>“Will it cost some more money to git it changed,
kunnel?”</p>

<p>“I suppose the clerk will charge about a dollar for
his extra work,” Gaitskill said. “I think I’ll let you
pay that dollar&mdash;you ought to have telephoned me
the woman’s name.”</p>

<p>Gaitskill pocketed the license and entered his
home. Tick went out on the street and sat down on
the pavement curbing with his feet in the gutter.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom is shore messed up dis bizzness awful
bad,” he sighed to himself. “Dat white man is
chargin’ me a puffeckly good dollar because he made
a miscue. Dat ain’t right.”</p>

<p>He thought the matter over for a while and then
broke into a low chuckle.</p>

<p>“By gosh, I b’lieve I’ll try dat on.”</p>

<p>He hastened down the street to Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>“Loant me five dollars, Skeeter!” he exclaimed
earnestly. “Marse Tom is done made a mistake wid
dat weddin’ paper an’ I wants to git it fixed up right
soon. He says it’ll cost me a dollar.”</p>

<p>The name of Gaitskill worked the miracle of liberality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
in Skeeter, and he handed over the money without
a word of protest.</p>

<p>“Now I’s done got financial agin,” Tick panted, as
he stepped rapidly along the street.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tremendous idea struck his brain and
shocked him to a standstill. He leaned weakly
against a convenient fence and waited till he could
recover. Then he began to laugh so loud that a
number of pickaninnies trotted out of the cabins and
came across to where they could observe him with
closer scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I’s done thunk up de onliest good idear I’s had
sence dis bizziness started,” he exclaimed to himself.
“I’s gwine peg it down befo’ de wind blows it away.”</p>

<p>He went straight to the kitchen of Judge Henry
Lanark, where Limit Lark was serving as cook. He
held an earnest and satisfactory conversation with
her for about five minutes, and then hurried to the
home of Colonel Gaitskill. Gaitskill was sitting
upon the front porch.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom,” Tick began eagerly, “is you had
dem license changed yit?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’s glad of dat, kunnel,” Tick chuckled. “I
don’t want ’em changed a-tall!”</p>

<p>“Why is that?”</p>

<p>“I done decided to marry Limit Lark, Marse
Tom,” Tick explained. “I talked it up wid Limit an’
she agreed wid me.”</p>

<p>“I thought you loved Button Hook,” Gaitskill
protested.</p>

<p>“I does love her pretty good, kunnel,” Tick snickered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
“But I been thinkin’ it over, an’ you wus
gwine charge me a dollar to change de names in dem
license, an’ I figger dat dar ain’t a dollar’s wuth of
diffunce between dem two nigger womens!”</p>

<p>Having made this arrangement by which he had
secured a marriage license, the promise of a wife, the
loan of five dollars which he never expected to repay,
and the saving of one dollar of his funds, Tick sauntered
away with a big chunk of tobacco in his cheek
and a large gob of peace in his soul.</p>

<p>Which goes to show that Tick’s social education
was progressing.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Button Hook was carefully
cleaning up the room in her home for the entertainment
of Tick Hush when he fulfilled his promise to
call that night and make the final arrangements for
their wedding.</p>

<p>In that same room, Button found Tick’s coat. He
had not taken it with him when her father appeared
with the shotgun.</p>

<p>With her first thought of wifely care, she picked up
the coat, brushed it until it was free from dust, then
gave it a hard shake.</p>

<p>Two letters fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Button stooped and picked them up. One was
addressed to Miss Limit Lark, and the other to Miss
Vakey Vapp.</p>

<p>Then, with true wifely curiosity, Button opened
both letters and read them. Except for the superscription,
they were exactly the same.</p>

<p>Almost every sentence was preceded by the word&mdash;“say.”
Button could not understand that, for she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
did not know that Tick had dictated while Skeeter
had written the letters, and Skeeter was not experienced
in writing dictation.</p>

<p>Here is an absolutely accurate transcription of
what Button read:</p>

Tick Hush</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Button had deciphered this communication
she placed both letters back in their envelopes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
hid them behind the clock. Then she removed the
little brass wrist-watch which Tick had given her
from her arm and placed that with the two letters.</p>

<p>After that she turned around and addressed aloud
the chair upon which Tick’s coat had rested:</p>

<p>“I wonder whut pap done wid dat double-barrel
shotgun of his’n?”</p>

<p>She threw Tick’s coat disdainfully upon the floor,
and stamped it with her feet.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine vowlate de law!” she announced. “I’s
gwine scramble de remainders of Tick Hush all over
Tickfall. Ef dey gits enough of him to hold a funeral
over, dey’ll have to mop de pieces up wid a rag!”</p>

<p>She walked back to the porch in the rear of the
house, and lifted down the heavy muzzle-loading
shotgun. She examined it carefully, muttering
threats.</p>

<p>“Lemme think,” she mumbled. “I b’lieve pap
said when you gits ready to shoot you cocks back bofe
hammers an’ pulls bofe triggers!”</p>

<p>She stepped out into the yard, the gun resting upon
her arm.</p>

<p>“Soon as it gits good dark, I’ll start,” she murmured.
“I muss git him befo’ de moon rises!”</p>

TICK CELEBRATES</h3>

<p>“I shore am feelin’ fine to-night,” Tick muttered,
as he walked away from Gaitskill’s home. “I feels
like a cel’bration of some kind. De fust notion whut
comes acrost my head, I’ll back it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>Feeling hungry, he wandered toward the Shin Bone
eating-house, and there, near the entrance, he met
Dazzle Zenor.</p>

<p>“How am de love case gittin’ on, Ticky?” she
giggled.</p>

<p>“Eve’ything is done sot an’ settled,” Tick grinned
back. “Dat piece of love lesson you gimme wus
suttinly a plenty.”</p>

<p>“You oughter stayed through it all, honey,”
Dazzle smiled. “I’d ’a’ learnt you how to flash de
glad eye, how to hold yo’ gal’s hand, how to hug her
so tight she’d holler fer her mammy, an’ how to bite
yo’ name in her cheek.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t need dat many lessons,” Tick informed
her.</p>

<p>“Rememberin’ dat you ain’t paid me nothin’ fer
whut I did learn you, it seems nachel to me dat you
oughter buy me somepin to eat,” Dazzle suggested.</p>

<p>“Dat’ll suit me,” Tick exclaimed. “I ain’t got de
same five dollars whut you gib me back, but I got
anodder five whut is jes’ as good.”</p>

<p>It did not occur to Tick until afterward that it is
not wise to tell an actress how much money you have
in your possession when you take her out to supper.</p>

<p>Dazzle revealed a perfectly amazing appetite for
both food and drink. She wanted her food cooked
in sundry unique and most expensive ways, and she
wanted a mixture of drinks which were several times
as expensive as any that Tick had ever had to pay
for.</p>

<p>For two hours they sat at the table laughing and
talking, and Dazzle found that she had merely to flatter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
Tick about his social accomplishments to get him
to go the limit financially.</p>

<p>Finally Dazzle announced that she had to go, and
refused to let Tick accompany her to her destination.</p>

<p>Left alone in the restaurant, Tick counted his
change and found that less than fifty cents remained
of the five dollars which Skeeter had lent him.</p>

<p>He left the restaurant, entered a nearby saloon,
and invested some more of his money in drink.
When he reappeared upon the street he possessed one
silver dime and a jag.</p>

<p>“Huh,” he grunted, as he looked down at the battered
dime. “I’s suttinly pretty well ’luminated up
to now. Wonder how come I still got dis here little
dime? I b’lieve I’ll buy a watermellyum.”</p>

<p>He entered the restaurant again, purchased a large
melon, and staggered solemnly down the street, hugging
it in his arms. He walked into a little grove of
trees and sat down on the ground.</p>

<p>By this time his ideas were extremely vague.</p>

<p>He cut his watermelon in two halves, carving across
the middle; he surveyed both ends with ludicrous
gravity, cogitating deeply.</p>

<p>Then remembering that he had left his hat in the
Shin Bone eating-house, he scooped all the red meat
out of one end of his melon, and turned the empty
rind over his head, fitting it on his skull like a cap!
Thinking at the same time that he needed a chair, he
scooped the red meat out of the other end of the
melon, and sat down in that half of the empty rind.
Having made himself comfortable, he proceeded with
his meal!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>“Hey!” he bawled to the world at large. “Dinner’s
ready! Come an’ git it!”</p>

<p>The thunder roared, and a summer shower, driven
before a strong Gulf breeze, swept over Tickfall. It
was gone in five minutes, and the moon came out
clear and bright, but the rain had drenched Tick
Hush to the skin.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing I fotch my hat out here wid
me,” he mumbled, holding the watermelon rind on
his head. “I mought ketch cold ef my head gits wet.
Gotter take keer of myse’f&mdash;gwine git married.”</p>

<p>The cold water had a slightly sobering effect upon
him, and he suddenly realized that he was without
his coat.</p>

<p>“Dar now! I done lef’ dat coat at Button Hook’s
house, an’ I done decided not to marrify Button.
Dat’s bad luck! I’ll go ax Skeeter Butts ’bout
dat!”</p>

<p>Still holding his watermelon-rind hat upon his
wabbly head, he staggered slowly down the street,
balancing himself carefully as he walked up the steps
of the saloon and entered the swinging door.</p>

<p>Then he stumbled and threw out both hands to
steady himself. His unique hat fell to the floor
breaking into a hundred fragments, and splashing to
all parts of the room. Tick gave a low moan of sorrow,
stepped on a piece of the melon, slid about ten
feet, and sat down upon the floor with a jolt which
almost loosened his ears.</p>

<p>He got to his feet with difficulty, motioned mysteriously
to Skeeter, and led the way to the room in the
rear.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>“Bad luck, Skeeter!” he growled. “I done messed
my mattermony up agin.”</p>

<p>“Slop it out!” Skeeter snapped. “Whut you done
now?”</p>

<p>“Button Hook is done promise to marry me,
an’ Limit Lark is done promise to marry me, an’
Dazzle Zenor is done promise to marry me&mdash;leastwise,
I think she done it. I cain’t remember real
good.”</p>

<p>“Why cain’t you remember?” Skeeter snarled.</p>

<p>“I’s so full of booze my y-ears is stopped up an’ my
back teeth is a-floatin’,” Tick explained.</p>

<p>“I know dat! Go on!”</p>

<p>“Whut griefs my mind is dis,” Tick went on. “I
lef’ my coat wid dem two marrifyin’ letters in it down
at Button’s house; Button is got my wrist-watch, an’
I ain’t gwine marry Button!”</p>

<p>“Aw, good gosh!” Skeeter exclaimed disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Whut is de most properest thing fer me to do nex’,
Skeeter?” Tick inquired with alcoholic gravity.</p>

<p>“You better do like a mud-turtle do!” Skeeter
snarled.</p>

<p>“How do a mud-turtle ack under dem succumstances?”
Tick inquired.</p>

<p>“When a turtle gits in trouble, he puts his hands
an’ foots in his pocket, takes a big breath, an’ swallers
his head, den he rolls offen a log an’ stays under
de water fer fawty days,” Skeeter informed him.</p>

<p>“Dat’s onpossible fer me to do, Skeeter,” Tick
replied earnestly. “I’d git drowndead shore, an’
Marse Tom don’t want no harm to happen to me.”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be no great big loss,” Skeeter snapped.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
“It ’pears to me like I could do widout you
powerful easy.”</p>

<p>“De lady folks would miss me,” Tick said with a
drunken grin.</p>

<p>“Git outen here, Tick, befo’ I git you put in jail,”
Skeeter howled. “You is a noosunce.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go back on yo’ lodge brudder, Skeeter,”
Tick begged. “Tell me whut to do to git outen my
jam.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Skeeter said ungraciously. “Go
down to Button Hook an’ git yo’ coat, yo’ letters, an’
yo’ wrist-watch back&mdash;an’ I hopes to Gawd dat
Button Hook will chaw you up an’ spit you out!”</p>

<p>“Marse Tom don’t want his pest-house nigger
ruint like dat!” Tick protested.</p>

<p>Skeeter pushed him out of the back door and
returned to the barroom.</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, Tick went slowly toward the cabin
occupied by Button Hook. Then he thought of
something which quickened his footsteps and gave
him courage.</p>

<p>“I won’t hab no trouble to git my coat back. I
jumped through dat winder an’ busted it to smashereens,
an’ of co’se it will be open.”</p>

<p>He sneaked up to the house from the side nearest
to the woods, and approached the window with the
utmost caution. Climbing in over the broken frame,
he felt about the room until he located his coat.
Thrusting his hand into the inside pocket, he brought
it out empty.</p>

<p>“Dey’s gone!” he sighed. “Mo’ an’ mo’ trouble
all de time!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>He stood thinking and listening until his attention
was attracted by the loud ticking of a clock in the
room.</p>

<p>“I gitcher!” he grinned. “Button said she hid de
wrist-watch behime de clock.”</p>

<p>He thrust his hand between the wall and the clock,
and in a hollow space behind the timepiece, he found
the watch and the two envelopes.</p>

<p>“Huh,” he grunted, “dese here is shore my losted
letters. De Lawd am shorely wid me.”</p>

<p>Climbing cautiously and noiselessly out of the
window, he walked out of the front gate, and, all
danger being over, he started jauntily down the
street. He felt care-free and happy once more, and
he began to sing.</p>

<p>Several hundred yards down the road Button Hook
heard him, and concealed herself behind a clump
of bushes. She carried a double-barreled, muzzle-loading
shotgun, and she had the face and manner of
one who was determined to use it.</p>

<p>Button had been hunting through all the negro
settlements of the town for the man who was now
approaching, singing at the top of his voice. She
listened to the song with an ugly smile upon her lips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Look on de sunny side,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Git on de sunny side,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stay on de sunny side<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of life!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song ended in a howl of fright.</p>

<p>Tick Hush came to a stand with both hands outstretched
to ward off the attack of a girl who stood in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the middle of the moonlit road with a shotgun at her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Git ready to die, Ticky!” she snarled. “Dis am
de end of you!”</p>

<p>Then both barrels of the gun went off at about
the same time.</p>

<p>Tick went off, too.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Tick, Button Hook was not familiar
with the use of firearms. She had heard her
father say that his old shotgun kicked like a yearling
mule. She was afraid of the gun, afraid of the noise
it made, and afraid of the kick. She had held it far
from her shoulder to avoid the rebound, had shut
both her eyes, and pulled both triggers. When the
gun went off she dropped it on the ground, and went
home at full speed, squalling at every step.</p>

<p>Tick leaped to one side of the road, tore both legs
off his pantaloons at the knee clambering over a
barbed-wire fence, and went howling through the
woods, bumping against nearly every tree in his
flight.</p>

<p>Like a crawfish, Tick went forward and looked
back.</p>

<p>When at last he felt that he had escaped from
danger, he was bleeding from a number of wounds on
his head, bleeding at both knees, bleeding where the
barbed-wire had cut his lips, and his nose was a
spouting fountain of red.</p>

<p>“I’ll go ax Skeeter Butts ’bout dis,” the wretched
man moaned.</p>

<p>When he staggered into the Hen-Scratch saloon
he made a big sensation. Negroes were standing at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the bar, others were playing pool, some were engaged
at various games at the table, and a big group was
assembled in the center of the room singing, cracking
jokes, and laughing as they smoked. The crowd
sprang up and rushed forward as Tick stumbled in,
sobbing like a little child.</p>

<p>“My Gawd, niggers!” he howled. “Marse Tom is
got to git him anodder nigger. Dis’n is plum’ ruint.
Send fer de dorctor! I’s been helt up an’ robbed an’
shotted to death!”</p>


<h3>X<br />

TICK SEEKS A PLACE TO DIE</h3>

<p>Tick flopped over on a battered pool-table, and
dyed the green cloth red with his blood.</p>

<p>A bunch of negroes gathered close around the
table, cackling their comments like a flock of excited
hens.</p>

<p>“I heerd dat gun go off!” Figger Bush squeaked.
“Dey shot him twicet. Dat gun went bang! bang!”</p>

<p>“Us heerd it, too,” Hitch Diamond growled. “He
shore is bad hurted. Dey shot bofe de legs off his
pants. I ’speck he fixin’ to die!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts talked excitedly over the telephone
and five minutes later a big automobile stopped in
front of his place, and Dr. Moseley came in.</p>

<p>“Get all these niggers out of here, Skeeter!” he
commanded sharply. “Clear the house!”</p>

<p>The negroes tramped out of the door like a drove
of horses going through a gap, and then they scattered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
to all parts of the town to carry the dreadful
news.</p>

<p>Dr. Moseley’s examination failed to find a single
gunshot wound.</p>

<p>“You are not shot, Tick,” Moseley said. “You’ve
been lying to these friends of yours. Somebody beat
you over the head with a club.”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh; dat warn’t it, doc,” Tick insisted.
“I wus shotted wid bofe barrels of a shotgun!”</p>

<p>“Tick don’t know whut happened, doc,” Skeeter
commented. “He come in here ’bout a hour ago so
full of booze dat he sloshed like a water-wagon when
he walked.”</p>

<p>Moseley bandaged the cut lips and legs and the
bruised head, and left Tick to the care and nursing
of Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; I’ll set up wid him all night, doc,”
Skeeter said. “He’s a fool frien’ of mine.”</p>

<p>Skeeter was aching to know exactly what had
happened to Tick, and as soon as the physician left,
Tick was served with a drink which sobered him
almost immediately, and then he told Skeeter all
about his affair in the road.</p>

<p>When Tick had finished, Skeeter sat for a long time
in deep thought, at intervals grunting like a pig when
some new idea punched him in a new place.</p>

<p>At last he rose to his feet and got his hat.</p>

<p>“Ticky,” he said, “you stay here till I gits back.”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Tick said pitifully. “I’s skeart to go
anywhar else; lock all de doors up tight.”</p>

<p>Skeeter ran across lots to his home on the premises
of Sheriff John Flournoy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>Flournoy had a little automobile, which he used
for fishing and hunting trips, and Skeeter pushed
this out of the garage, cranked it, and jumped to the
seat. In a few minutes he was back again at the
saloon.</p>

<p>“Climb in dis machine, Ticky,” he commanded.
“A leetle fresh air will rest yo’ mind an’ do you good.
Git in!”</p>

<p>Then Skeeter steered the machine straight toward
the home of Button Hook. Tick uttered angry and
frightened protests, but in vain. Skeeter persisted in
his plan.</p>

<p>“Dis is whar it happened, Skeeter,” Tick said as
they passed a place in the road. “Dis is whar I wus
shotted!”</p>

<p>“Whoa!” Skeeter said, as he brought the car to a
stop. “Look dar&mdash;dat is de gun whut Button
drapped!”</p>

<p>Placing the gun in the machine, Skeeter hurried
on toward Button Hook’s home.</p>

<p>“Dis gun will he’p me a heap!” he exulted.</p>

<p>When they reached the house, Skeeter picked up
the shotgun and, leaving Tick in the machine, he
walked through the yard, stamped up the steps and
onto the little porch, and knocked loudly and authoritatively
upon the door. He heard shuffling noises
with low talking, and movements which indicated
that the occupants of the house were waking from
sleep and getting out of bed.</p>

<p>“Who dar?” old man Hook inquired in a frightened
voice.</p>

<p>“Open up!” Skeeter yelled. “I got a little word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
wid you an’ Button Hook from Sheriff John Flournoy
an’ Doc Moseley.”</p>

<p>At this there was a frightened squeal from Button
Hook, excited voices talking, swift movement of
feet, and the door opened a little crack. Old Hook
stuck his corkscrew whiskers through the opening
and asked:</p>

<p>“Whut word is sont?”</p>

<p>“I’s got Ticky Hush out here in Sheriff John
Flournoy’s autermobile,” Skeeter announced in a
loud voice. “Ticky is been shot two times wid a
double-barrel, muzzle-loadin’ shotgun. Nobody ain’t
know who done it, but we done foun’ de shotgun, an’
Marse Tom is tryin’ to find out who owns it.”</p>

<p>Button Hook uttered a frightened whine.</p>

<p>“Doc Moseley say Ticky is gittin’ ready to die
befo’ mawnin’,” Skeeter resumed. “Ticky ain’t got
no kinnery an’ I knowed he wus gwine marry Button
Hook, so I fetch him down here so he could die in yo’-all’s
house!”</p>

<p>“Gawda’mighty, naw!” old Hook wailed. “I
don’t want no dead nigger in my cabin. Take him
somewheres else.”</p>

<p>“It’s Marse John Flournoy’s awders to leave him
here wid you-alls!” Skeeter lied.</p>

<p>“Naw!” Daddy Hook squalled. “Dis fambly
ain’t gwine be home in de mawnin’&mdash;us is gittin’
ready trabble to right now, an’ we’s fixin’ to take a
soon start!”</p>

<p>“Does you know who dis shotgun belongs to?”
Skeeter asked, producing the gun with a dramatic
flourish.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>“Naw!” Daddy Hook wailed, motioning Skeeter
away. “Ain’t never seed dat gun befo’.”</p>

<p>A frightened wail sounded behind old man Hook,
informing Skeeter that Button was being strongly
affected by what she heard.</p>

<p>“All right!” Skeeter said, as if in doubt what to do
next. “I’ll go tell Marse John Flournoy dat you-all
won’t take Tick in. I reckon him an’ Marse Tom
Gaitskill will come right down an’ cornverse you-all
about it. De Sheriff don’t take no nigger foolishness.”</p>

<p>Skeeter turned and walked away. When he got to
the automobile it was empty. Tick had climbed out
and had hidden behind the same stump which had
served him when he delivered the wrist-watch to
Button Hook. As Skeeter cranked the machine,
Tick emerged from his hiding-place and climbed back
into the car.</p>

<p>“Now, Ticky,” Skeeter said when they were once
more in the saloon and had sat down. “A long time
befo’ mawnin’, Button Hook an’ all dat crowd will be
gittin’ to some place fur away in a mighty big hurry.
Dey’ll trabble wid a looseness, an’ dey won’t look
back, an’ dey won’t never come back.”</p>

<p>“Dey won’t make me mad ef dey stays away,”
Tick spoke, trying to grin through his cut and plaster-covered
lips.</p>

<p>“Dat saves yo’ life, an’ it gits you good riddunce
of one of yo’ to-be wives!”</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh,” Tick said gratefully. “You
shore is a noble nigger man!”</p>

<p>“You tole me dat Dazzle promise to marry you&mdash;is
dat so?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>“Naw, suh. Me an’ Dazzle et a little dinner
togedder, but dar ain’t nothin’ to dat.”</p>

<p>“Dat leaves jes’ Limit Lark fer you to marry&mdash;ain’t
dat so?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“Dat’s all!” Tick said. “Thank de Lawd!”</p>

<p>“You done got yo’ license to marry Limit, Ticky,”
Skeeter said. “Now, fer goodness sake don’t ax
nobody else!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Tick promised. “I’s mighty glad we’s
done shaved ’em down to jes’ me an’ one woman.”</p>

<p>There was a loud knock upon the front door, and
some one on the outside shook it violently, trying to
get in.</p>

<p>“Git over dar an’ crawl under de bar, Ticky,”
Skeeter whispered. “Dar ain’t no tellin’ whut is
gwine happen now!”</p>

<p>When Tick was hidden, Skeeter tiptoed to the door
and opened it very cautiously.</p>

<p>“Dis here is Vakey Vapp,” a woman’s voice announced
in high, shrill tones. “Lemme in, I got
somepin to say offen my mind!”</p>

<p>“Come in, Vakey,” Skeeter said in propitiating
tones. “I’s de onliest one here.”</p>

<p>“Whar is Tick Hush?” Vakey snapped.</p>

<p>“Tick is gittin’ ready to die,” Skeeter answered
evasively. “Doc Moseley is he’pin’ him along.”</p>

<p>“I come here to tell Tick dat he better make a good
job of dyin’, an’ drap off real soon,” Vakey bellowed.
“Ef he don’t, I’s gwine meet him in de big road an’
cyarve his gizzard an’ his backbone out!”</p>

<p>“Whut’s done made you mad?” Skeeter asked in
surprised tones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>“Dat nigger is done monkeyed wid my affectations,”
Vakey howled.</p>

<p>“Dat’s too bad,” Skeeter sympathized.</p>

<p>“It don’t hurt me none, but it’s shore bad fer
Tick!” Vakey said in a deadly tone.</p>

<p>Then they sat for a long time in silence, while
Vakey Vapp breathed deeply with a heaving breast,
like a motion-picture star. At last she stood up to go.</p>

<p>“I comed here to gib Ticky Hush a dyin’ message,
Skeeter,” she announced. “I’s sorry he ain’t here.
But ef Doc Moseley makes a mistake an’ cures Tick,
well, I’s gwine bestow my dyin’ message wid de edge
of a sharp razor. Good-by!”</p>

<p>When the door closed behind her, Tick stood up
from his hiding-place, showing a face full of tragedy
and despair.</p>

<p>“We forgot all about dat one, Skeeter,” he
mourned. “Oh, lawdy! Ef I ever gits outen dis
mess, I ain’t gwine mess wid mattermony no more!”</p>


<h3>XI<br />

TICK FLIES THE YELLOW FLAG</h3>

<p>Early the next morning, Colonel Tom Gaitskill
heard from Hitch Diamond, who worked about his
place, that Tick Hush had been held up, robbed, and
shot to death.</p>

<p>At the bank, where Vinegar Atts worked, Gaitskill
heard that a woman named Button Hook had shot
Tick Hush, and that Skeeter had nursed him all night.</p>

<p>From Dr. Moseley Gaitskill learned that Tick had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
not been shot or robbed, but had been beaten over
the head with some blunt instrument, and his face
had been badly cut with some sharp tool.</p>

<p>All of which was interesting enough to induce
Gaitskill to make a personal investigation.</p>

<p>He found Tick Hush lying upon a pallet in the rear
of the Hen-Scratch saloon, and from him and Skeeter
Butts he heard the whole story.</p>

<p>Being familiar with the details of numberless
negro courtships, this lengthy narrative lacked the
spice of novelty, and Gaitskill was weary long before
it was finished.</p>

<p>At last he looked at his watch and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Well, Tick,” he smiled, “I think if I were in your
predicament I would go out to the pest-house on my
farm and run up the yellow flag.”</p>

<p>Then Gaitskill went back to the bank.</p>

<p>The two negroes sat in perfect silence for a long
time. Finally Tick asked:</p>

<p>“Skeeter, whut did Marse Tom mean by dem
words?”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows,” Skeeter mumbled.</p>

<p>Skeeter smoked four cigarettes in rapid succession.
Then the meaning of Gaitskill’s remark shot through
him like an electric current.</p>

<p>Given Gaitskill’s two, he multiplied and made
forty-four.</p>

<p>He grabbed his hat and ran up the street at full
speed.</p>

<p>He stopped first at the home of Ginny Babe Chew,
where he held an excited conversation with Dazzle
Zenor, the actress. That young woman laughed and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
applauded, and promptly left the house after Skeeter’s
rapid departure.</p>

<p>After that, he ran to the livery stable and held an
excited conversation with the negro owner of that
establishment.</p>

<p>The liveryman was not at all disposed to do what
Skeeter wanted, but Skeeter had learned certain conjuring
tricks to attain his ends, and he now performed
these tricks with the influential names of
Colonel Tom Gaitskill, Sheriff John Flournoy, and
Dr. Moseley.</p>

<p>With these big names thundering in his ears, the
liveryman consented.</p>

<p>“Keep dis quiet, Lon!” Skeeter warned. “It’s
de white folks’ awders. Don’t speak a word!”</p>

<p>Two hours later, a long, black carriage, known to
the negroes of Tickfall as the “pest-wagon,” drawn
by two solemn mules and driven by Skeeter Butts,
stopped at the rear door of the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>Skeeter dismounted from the driver’s seat and
opened the door in the rear of the ambulance. Hitch
Diamond, Figger Bush, and the Reverend Vinegar
Atts climbed out. They pulled a stretcher into view,
and Skeeter laid hold upon it.</p>

<p>They tramped into the Hen-Scratch saloon like a
quartette of pall-bearers, and walked to the pallet
where Dazzle Zenor, the actress, now acting the part
of a Red Cross nurse, had just completed a major
operation upon the face and hands of Tick Hush.
Tick was lifted upon the stretcher, carried to the
ambulance and placed inside.</p>

<p>Skeeter tied a piece of yellow cloth a yard wide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
and two yards long to the door knob of the ambulance,
and climbed back to the driver’s seat.</p>

<p>The four stretcher bearers walked solemnly beside
the pest-wagon.</p>

<p>Every negro inhabitant of Dirty-Six crowded the
sidewalks and watched this dreadful wagon go by.
All the older ones recalled that fearful epidemic of
yellow fever years before when this wagon had rolled
along the streets at midnight, and a driver with
muffled mouth, breathing through a cloth saturated
with disinfectants, called aloud in sepulchral
tones:</p>

<p>“Bring out your dead!”</p>

<p>For the first time in thirty years, the pest-wagon
was on the streets of Tickfall again. It was no
longer a shiny, black vehicle, but was rusty, dusty,
weather-beaten, and time-worn, more than ever suggestive
of diseases and pestilence and sudden death.</p>

<p>As the stretcher bearers marched, they sang.
The superb baritone of the Reverend Vinegar Atts
rolled like an organ:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Somebody buried in de graveyard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Somebody buried in de sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gwine to git up in de mawnin’<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shoutin’ de jubilee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you git dare befo’ I do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run an’ tell de Lawd I’m comin’, too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somebody dyin’ on de mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Somebody dyin’ in de bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somebody gwine to rise like a fountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gwine to rise from de dead!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
<span class="i0">Oh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you git dar befo’ I do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run an’ tell de Lawd I’m comin’, too!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Git back, niggers!” Hitch Diamond bellowed to
the crowd when he saw they were disposed to follow.
“Keep away! I got awders from de white folks!”</p>

<p>In front of the home of Vakey Vapp the ambulance
came to a stop.</p>

<p>“Come out here, Vakey!” Skeeter called.</p>

<p>Vakey stepped out into the middle of her yard with
plenty of fresh, untainted air around her.</p>

<p>“You tole me las’ night dat you wanted to deliver
to Tick Hush a dyin’ message!” Skeeter exclaimed
as he opened the door of the ambulance. “Come up
close so you kin speak to him!”</p>

<p>Vakey took a half-step forward and stopped.</p>

<p>Skeeter spread wide the doors of the ambulance and
exclaimed dramatically:</p>

<p>“Stick out yo’ head, Ticky, an’ git yo’ dyin’
word!”</p>

<p>Ticky stuck out his head.</p>

<p>Dazzle Zenor had done her work well.</p>

<p>The actress had exhausted all her paints and all her
mental resources in helping Tick in his theatrical
make-up for the part he had to play.</p>

<p>The result was simply horrifying!</p>

<p>Tick’s ears were both a bright green in color, his
nose was yellow, his lips were purple, his forehead
was a bright red, and his cheeks were as white as milk,
while under his chin the natural brown of his skin
was striped with orange!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>Tick held up both hands with a pitiful gesture, and
each finger was a different color!</p>

<p>Vakey Vapp emitted a squall which put her in a
class by herself as a maker of strange, loud noises.</p>

<p>“Pore ole Ticky is got some kind of ketchin’ disease,
Vakey,” Skeeter exclaimed. “Us is takin’ him
out to de pest-house.”</p>

<p>“Whut ails him?” Vakey wailed.</p>

<p>“Doc Moseley specify dat Tick is got scrambaloodums,
an’ it’s powerful ketchin’. Is you touched
Ticky any time recent?”</p>

<p>“O Lawd yes!” Vakey screamed. “I rush-housed
him powerful bad at de Shoofly chu’ch de yuther
night!”</p>

<p>“I’s mighty sorry to hear you speak dem words,
Vakey,” Skeeter said with a tearful tremolo in his
voice. “You’ll kotch de scrambaloodums, too.
We’ll come back an’ take you to de pest-house
next!”</p>

<p>Skeeter shut the ambulance door and ostentatiously
draped the yellow flag over the knob.</p>

<p>“You fergot to deliver yo’ dyin’ message, Vakey,”
Skeeter reminded her.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nothin’,” Vakey howled. “O my lawdymussy!”</p>

<p>“All right,” Skeeter said. “You kin speak yo’
dyin’ words when we takes you out to de pest-house
whar Tick is gwine!”</p>

<p>Vakey gave another loud squall and started across
the fields toward the woods, going at full speed, and
covering a long distance in a very brief time.</p>

<p>“She’ll be mighty fur away pretty soon&mdash;ef she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
keeps up dat gait,” the Reverend Vinegar Atts
chuckled. “Dat’s jes’ de way de niggers runned
from de pest-house thirty years ago!”</p>

<p>Skeeter clucked to his mules and started off at a
brisk trot, leaving the three other stretcher bearers
in the middle of the road, looking at the cloud of dust
the team raised.</p>

<p>“Come on, niggers,” Vinegar Atts chuckled as he
turned back toward the town. “We done runned
Vakey off now&mdash;less git aroun’ among de niggers an’
succulate de repote dat Skeeter an’ Tick is gittin’
ready to git up a show!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Figger Bush cackled. “We’ll tell
’em dis ain’t no real disease, but Tick an’ Skeeter is
rehearsin’!”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t really needful to do dat,” Hitch Diamond
rumbled. “Excusin’ Vakey, all of ’em knows it ’tain’t
nothin’ but a joke nohow. Niggers didn’t sing no
religium tunes aroun’ dis pest-wagon thuty year ago
when de yeller fever kotch us.”</p>


<h3>XII<br />

LIMIT GOES THE LIMIT</h3>

<p>Two hours later, a wagon drawn by two mules, and
occupied by three men and one woman, stopped on
top of a hill near the pest-house.</p>

<p>With shouts of laughter the four colored people
looked down at the four-room stone house with the
metal roof, behind which were many graves and leaning
tombstones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>In front of the building was a yellow flag, draped
from the limb of a small tree. Skeeter Butts sat in
front, his chair-back propped against the stone wall,
smoking his cigarette.</p>

<p>They climbed out of the wagon, Limit Lark, the
Reverend Vinegar Atts, Figger Bush, and Hitch
Diamond.</p>

<p>After consulting with his two male companions,
Vinegar Atts conducted Limit Lark to a little knoll
about one hundred feet from the pest-house, and
told her to stand there until he could complete his
arrangements.</p>

<p>Then he took his own stand on another little rise of
land, with Figger Bush and Hitch Diamond beside
him.</p>

<p>“Hey, Tick Hush!” Vinegar bawled in a voice
which could be heard a mile. “Come out to de front
of de pest-house a minute!”</p>

<p>Tick had been busy trying to get the make-up off
his face, and he emerged from the building and stared
about him in surprise.</p>

<p>“Listen, Tick!” Vinegar Atts whooped. “I got
somepin to say to you. Will you take Limit Lark to
be yo’ wedded wife?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly!” Tick squalled, after a moment of
astonished silence and a kick from Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>“Limit, will you take Tick Hush to be yo’ wedded
husbunt?” Vinegar bellowed.</p>

<p>“You bet!” Limit shrieked.</p>

<p>“Jine yo’ right hands!” Vinegar howled.</p>

<p>“Aw, dat won’t do to say,” Hitch Diamond
growled. “It cain’t be did.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>Vinegar hesitated a moment, then got his second
wind and bawled:</p>

<p>“I now pernounce you husbunt an’ wife, an’ may
de good Lawd hab mussy on yo’ souls. Amen!”</p>

<p>“Come away from dis pest-house, Tick!” Skeeter
snapped as soon as the ceremony was ended. “I
been skeart to death fer eve’y minute I been here, an’
I’s smoked cigareetes to keep de ketchin’ miseries
away till I sees double!”</p>

<p>The two men ran up the hill toward Limit Lark.</p>

<p>Limit took one horrified look at her husband’s face
and reeled backward.</p>

<p>Dazzle Zenor had failed to tell Tick how to get the
make-up off his face, and now he was an awful looking
thing.</p>

<p>He had rubbed the various paints with a dry cloth
and had made a horrifying smear; he had washed
the paints with hot and cold water, and some of the
colors had “run,” and the effect was one which would
make any alcoholic imagine he had ’em again and
mount the water-wagon.</p>

<p>“My Gawd, Ticky!” Limit shrieked. “How
come you got yo’ face in such a devilish mess?”</p>

<p>“I’s had bad luck, honey,” Tick said mournfully.
“I s’pose I got to wait till dis paint wears off!”</p>

<p>“You ain’t nothin’ but a gorm!” Limit shrieked.
“You look like a Whut-is-it in a circus show!”</p>

<p>“Cain’t he’p it, honey,” Tick replied. “It’ll wear
off in about six months!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Vinegar Atts howled. “Marse
Tom Gaitskill sent word by me dat you two niggers
is in quaremtime fer six months. Ef you or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Limit comes to town, he’ll hab you put in de jailhouse.”</p>

<p>“Limit kin wear a blind bridle till you git yo’
nachel-bawn color back, Ticky,” Skeeter snickered.
“Good-by!”</p>

<p>The four stretcher bearers left the bride and groom
and walked up the hill to where their mules were
standing.</p>

<p>When Skeeter picked up his driving lines he broke
into a loud cackle of laughter.</p>

<p>“Say, fellers,” he snickered. “Ain’t dat Tick
Hush a funny nigger man? Ef you wus to set him in
one of dese here revolvin’ chairs, he wouldn’t hab
sense enough to turn aroun’.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="A_Corner_in_Pickaninnies">A Corner in Pickaninnies</h2>


<p>A mocking-bird sang his delirious music unnoticed
above the head of Skeeter Butts as he sat beneath a
chinaberry tree trying to recover from the shock of the
latest negro sensation in Tickfall&mdash;the separation of
Shin Bone and his wife.</p>

<p>“Dey shore got through wid demselves powerful
soon,” he muttered to himself as he lighted a fresh
cigarette upon the stub of the old one. “Dey ain’t
been married but ’bout three years, an’ deir baby
tuck de prize at de baby show.”</p>

<p>He propped his chair back against the trunk of the
tree, tipped his derby hat down upon the bridge of his
nose, put his shoe-heels inside the front rungs of the
chair, and puffed his smoke in deep meditation.</p>

<p>“Wonder how come dey busted up?” he mused
aloud in a low tone. “I reckin it’s one of dese here
do-mes-tic in-feli-city cases. <i>Hush!</i> Look at who’s
drawin’ nigh!”</p>

<p>The front legs of Skeeter’s chair came down upon
the sand with a thump, he straightened his derby
upon his closely shaved head, adjusted his high collar,
and his noisy cravat, and waited.</p>

<p>Whiffle Bone came around the rear of the saloon,
leading her two-year-old boy by the hand. Skeeter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
sprang up, gave her a chair, and seated himself. The
baby dropped upon the ground and began the construction
of a sand house.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken until both were comfortably
seated, then Shin Bone’s wife began:</p>

<p>“Me an’ Shin is picked a fuss wid each yuther an’
quit.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter answered sympathetically.</p>

<p>The woman sat twisting her nervous hands, biting
her lips, and turning at intervals to look behind her
as if she expected some one to follow her. Finally
she leaned over, rested her elbows upon her lap and
her head upon her hands and began to cry, wailing like
a calliope.</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Skeeter gasped sucking the stub
of his lighted cigarette into his mouth in his surprise.
He sprang up, gagged, clawed at his lips, dancing
first on one foot, then on the other.</p>

<p>“Aw, hush!” Skeeter howled at last, when he had
rescued himself from the fire. “Shut up! Ef you
wanter bust up wid Shin Bone, bust&mdash;but don’t
beller! Ef you wanter cornfess up to me about yo’
troubles, bawl out&mdash;but don’t beller! Ef you wanter
pull my leg fer a few loose change to git back to yo’
home folks, go ahead an’ pull&mdash;but fer <i>Gawd’s</i> sake,
don’t beller! Dis ain’t de right season of de year fer
a long wet spell like you done started&mdash;it’ll spile de
craps!”</p>

<p>Any married man could have told Skeeter that the
best way to turn a light summer shower into a cloud-burst
of rainfall was to admonish a woman not to cry.
As it was, Skeeter learned this fact on this occasion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
by hard experience. The louder Skeeter bawled, the
louder Whiffle Bone “bellered,” and finally Skeeter
sat down in despair and began to fiddle with a brass
wrist-watch which he wore.</p>

<p>Gradually Whiffle’s wails died down to an occasional
blobbering gurgle, like water pouring out of the
choked neck of a bottle. When she straightened up
and began to mop the tears from her cheeks with the
corner of her apron, Skeeter inquired:</p>

<p>“Whut made you an’ Shin explode yo’ fambly
life?”</p>

<p>“Money!” Whiffle answered shortly. “I done
all de cookin’ an’ de waitin’ on at our eatin’-house.
Shin, he done light haulin’ wid de hoss an’ wagin, cut
all de wood, an’ hauled it outen de swamp, an’ cleant
up de eatin’-house befo’ breakfust in de mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“You-all ’vided up yo’ wuck pretty even,” Skeeter
remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. But Shin, he argufy dat de money
oughter be ’vided up even, too; me, I argufy dat I
oughter keep all de money an’ gib Shin jes’ as much as
I figgered he oughter hab.”</p>

<p>“Cain’t you-all compermise yo’ ’spute no way?”
Skeeter inquired.</p>

<p>“De only way fer Shin to compermise wid me is to
comp’ on my own terms,” Whiffle wailed. “Ain’t
dat so?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter agreed readily. “Sometimes a
nigger man kin compermise wid a woman an’ git her
to take his own terms; but fust of all, he’s got to
bounce ’bout seven rocks offen her head.”</p>

<p>This remark started Whiffle again, and the sobs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
began to pop from her throat like the exhaust of a
gasoline engine.</p>

<p>“Aw, shuckins!” Skeeter grumbled. “Now I
done gone an’ punched a hole in de water-barrel agin.
Shut up, Whiffle! You’s too durn moistuous to suit
me&mdash;ef I ’a’ knowed you wus cornin’ here to wet me
wid all yo’ fambly troubles, I’d borrered a rubber
divin’-suit!” In his exasperation, Skeeter hurled his
cigarette-stub to the ground, and sat glaring around
him, wondering what to do.</p>

<p>Whiffle’s baby picked up the cigarette-stub, put
the lighted end into his mouth, and emitted a yelp
which raised Skeeter out of his chair, and which
trailed off into a series of shuddering wails like the
call of a screech-owl.</p>

<p>“My good gosh!” Skeeter howled, glaring indignantly
at the youngster and his mother. “De ole
she-bear an’ de cub <i>bofe</i> at it now! Whut you wanter
wish all dis Gulf of Mex’co full of tears onto me fer?
I’s gwine build me a Noer’s ark!”</p>

<p>Whiffle promptly forgot her tears in an effort to
assuage the grief of her son.</p>

<p>“Po’ little pickaninny&mdash;mammy’s little darlin’!”
she crooned, as she lifted him upon her lap. “You
want mammy to sing you a song? Listen, honey,
shet yo’ eyes an’ shet yo’ mouf, an’ cock yo’ ears an’
listen!”</p>

<p>The tears were glistening upon her wet cheeks, as
she drew the little boy close to her and crooned:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“De black pot’s bigger dan a fryin’ pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An’ upon dis groun’ I takes my stan’&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’d druther be a nigger dan a po’ white man!”<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
</div></div>

<p>“Huh!” Skeeter Butts murmured to himself as he
watched the woman and her child. “I wonder do
she really love dat kid, or is she huggin’ him jes’ to
spite Shin Bone? I never knowed who my mammy
or daddy wus, an’ I don’t got no way to find out.”</p>

<p>As the woman sang, she looked off across the
spaces, focusing her tear-wet eyes upon the purple
haze which hung above the Little Moccasin Swamp.
In a moment, the whimpering of the baby ceased,
and his tired head rested in sleep upon his young
mother’s ample bosom. After a while Whiffle
reverted to her trouble with her husband.</p>

<p>“I been keepin’ all de money sence we wus married,
Skeeter, so when me an’ Shin quit I jes’ tied up
de loose change in a stockin’-toe an’ fotch it away wid
me. Dat leaves Shin de eatin’-house an’ de hoss an’
wagin.”</p>

<p>“I figger dat wus fair,” Skeeter replied in an earnest
desire to be propitiatory and prevent any more
tears.</p>

<p>“Whut I come to see you ’bout is dis, Skeeter: who
do dis little pickaninny b’long to?” and as she spoke,
Whiffle hugged the little boy closer to her and gazed
down fondly on his tear-marked face.</p>

<p>Skeeter saw here another opportunity to break
up the fountains of the great deep and start a flood
of tears, so he sought for a diplomatic answer in
hope of preventing a crevasse.</p>

<p>“Shin is his daddy, you is his mammy&mdash;he b’longs
to you bofe,” Skeeter replied.</p>

<p>“I figger dat he is my chile,” Mrs. Bone said,
beginning to sniffle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter answered hastily. “I thinks
so, too!”</p>

<p>“Shin figgers dat little Shinny is his chile,” Mrs.
Bone remarked, sniffling some more.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter grunted. “Yes’m! Dat’s so!”</p>

<p>“I’s got de chile now, but Shin say he’s gwine take
him away from me,” Mrs. Bone declared, and now
the shower of tears began with a rush. “Whut muss
I do?”</p>

<p>“You mought stop dis weepin’-willer, deep-mournin’
stunt till I kin git my brains to thinkin’,”
Skeeter suggested. “You gib me de muddlegrubs
cuttin’ up like dis! Why don’t you take de chile an’
run off somewheres?”</p>

<p>“’Twon’t do no good,” Whiffle sobbed. “Shin
would foller atter me an’ take little Shinny away!”</p>

<p>“You mought let Shin keep him half de time, an’
you keep him half de time,” Skeeter proposed.</p>

<p>“Ef Shin ever gits holt of dis boy, he’ll keep him
all de time,” Whiffle wailed.</p>

<p>“Aw, mud!” Skeeter vociferated, staring at the
weeping woman. “I never seed sech a puddle as
you make out of yo’se’f. Dry up!”</p>

<p>The conversation ceased for about ten minutes, but
the silence was constantly shattered by the cork-popping
sobs of Whiffle.</p>

<p>“Skeeter,” she pleaded finally, “would you wish
to he’p me keep my little boy all fer myse’f? I kin
take better keer of him dan Shin.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I’s willin’ to he’p,” Skeeter said uncertainly.
“You see, I ain’t never been married an’ I
don’t know nothin’ ’bout chillun or deir mammies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
I don’t know jes’ perzackly whut I kin do. It might
be dangersome fer a igernunt nigger like me to butt
into mattermony matters.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no danger,” Whiffle replied quickly.
“Shin is gwine try to steal dis chile from me ternight,
an’ I wants you to he’p me guard him.”</p>

<p>Skeeter lighted a cigarette and sat puffing at it for
a long time. Then his eyes began to sparkle, and he
said with a chuckle:</p>

<p>“I’ll take you up on dat, Whiffle.”</p>

<p>“Whut is you gwine do?” Whiffle asked, her face
shining with relief.</p>

<p>“I dopes it out like dis,” Skeeter answered. “A
new nigger woman is visitin’ in dis town, an’ me an her
begun to shine up to each yuther real prompt. She’s
got a little boy jes’ de size an’ age an’ color of dis here
brat of your’n.”</p>

<p>“Dat don’t he’p me none,” Whiffle mourned.</p>

<p>“When I talks&mdash;you listen!” Skeeter snapped.
“Don’t try to bake no biscuits till I git done mixin’
de dough! All I wants you to do is to git de repote
to Shin Bone private an’ confidential dat you is gwine
out of town fer a little rest an’ dat I will keep yo’ baby
till you gits back. Atter dat, jes’ take yo’ brat an’
go!”</p>

<p>“But ef I takes him wid me, you won’t hab him,”
Whiffle whined.</p>

<p>“Oh, my big toe!” Skeeter snarled. “I don’t
blame Shin Bone fer gittin’ a deevo’ce&mdash;you ain’t got
no sense! Whut I means is dis: I’ll borrer my lady
frien’s little boy to-night. Shin will git de repote dat
I am keepin’ little Shinny. Of co’se, Shin will come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
to de Hen-Scratch an’ swipe de chile I’m got an’ run
away. When daylight comes, he’ll discover dat he’s
got some yuther nigger’s boy!”</p>

<p>“I sees,” Whiffle whimpered. “But ef Shin come
an’ swipes de wrong baby, whut will yo’ lady frien’
say to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” Skeeter replied. “She won’t hab no
kick-back. Of co’se, when Shin finds out dat he’s
got de wrong pup by de year, he’ll jes’ nachelly fotch
him back to his real maw. Nobody don’t want
somebody else’s yearlin’.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Whiffle muttered. “I’d hate to
loant my honey boy fer dat puppus, but mebbe yo’
lady frien’ is diff’unt. I’ll succulate de repote of me
leavin’ so Shin kin git it.”</p>

<p>“Good-by!” Skeeter grinned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few minutes after Whiffle had gone, Skeeter
Butts left his business in charge of his assistant and
started toward the home of Mustard Prophet, where
his new friend was visiting. He found her sitting
on the porch, entertaining her little boy.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Happy!” he greeted her. “How’s you
an’ de little boy to-day?”</p>

<p>“Us is feelin’ fine,” Happy smiled. “How come
you is runnin’ aroun’ when you oughter be keepin’
bar?”</p>

<p>“I come to cornverse you ’bout a little bizzness,”
Skeeter answered promptly.</p>

<p>“Come up an’ set down!” the young woman
invited, pushing aside and making a place for him on
the bench she occupied. “Rest yo’ hat, put yo’ foots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
on de porch rail, light a cigar, wind yo’ watch&mdash;jes’
make yo’se’f at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter grinned, as he seated himself
beside her. “Yo’ name is shore a good sign of yo’
disposition&mdash;bofe is happy. But, Happy, ef yo’
name gimme de lock-jaw eve’y time I pernounced it,
it would still taste awful good to me!”</p>

<p>“You muss hab kissed de coal-oil can befo’ you lef’
de Hen-Scratch, Skeeter,” Happy responded. “Yo’
nigger tongue is mighty slick!”</p>

<p>Skeeter ignored the remark and looked the woman
over with appraising eyes. She was tall, slim, graceful,
dark-skinned, bright-eyed, with an easy-smiling,
good-natured mouth. Her home was in Baton
Rouge, her dress and manner bespoke the city, and
Skeeter’s susceptible heart was deeply affected.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a beautiful chile,” Skeeter remarked fondly,
as he gazed at the little boy who sat on the floor
trying to see how close he could poke his finger
toward the business end of a wasp without getting
stung.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, I’s shore proud of my baby,” the
woman smiled.</p>

<p>“Would you loant him to me fer a little while to-night,
Happy?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p>“Whut you wanter do wid him?”</p>

<p>“He’s such a diff’unt-lookin’ kid to all dese here
dirty pickaninnies in dis town dat I flggered it would
be a good edgercation fer dese here home niggers to
see him,” Skeeter recited glibly. “Me an’ Sheriff
Flournoy follers up de Nigger Uplift Movement, an’
I don’t know nothin’ dat’ll put good notions in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
nigger’s head like gittin’ a look at dis nice, dean,
dressy nigger boy.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it de trufe!” Happy exclaimed proudly.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Skeeter continued. “I figger dat I
could take yo’ little boy to de Hen-Scratch to-night,
show him off, brag on him, an’ make dese home niggers
ashamed of deir offsprings&mdash;ain’t dat so?”</p>

<p>“Shore is!” Happy replied. “I wisht I could be
dar an’ hear you brag yo’ brags on him.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t possible,” Skeeter exclaimed quickly.
“Womans ain’t be allowed in de Scratch. But ef yo’
little boy makes a hit, I might could git de Revun
Vinegar Atts to gib a baby show at de Shoofly
chu’ch, an’ I’m shore yo’ little boy would tote off de
prize.”</p>

<p>“You kin hab him, Skeeter!” the woman exclaimed
exultantly. “You come fer him to-night atter supper.
I’ll hab him all dressed up like a circus bandwagon.
Only I gibs you dis advice right now: don’t
grab my chile by de lef’ arm onless you wants him to
sot up a howl. Dat arm is powerful sore!”</p>

<p>“I’ll lead him by de han’ like a gen’leman,”
Skeeter grinned. “Whut is de name he’s called
by?”</p>

<p>“I calls him Ready Rocket&mdash;atter his deceasted
paw,” Happy told him.</p>

<p>“I’ll come by fer him atter dark, Mrs. Rocket,”
Skeeter declared, as he reached for his hat. “Git
him ready.”</p>

<p>As Skeeter walked down the street a new idea came
to him.</p>

<p>“Dat woman is gwine dress up dat kid like a Mardi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Gras, an’ Shin won’t swipe him&mdash;Shin’ll know dat
ain’t his’n. I wonder is Whiffle lef’ town yit?”</p>

<p>Skeeter hastened to Pap Curtain’s cabin and found
that Whiffle had not.</p>

<p>“Whiffle,” he said, “I come mighty nigh fergittin’
a mos’ important bizzness. I want some of little
Shinny’s ole ragged clothes. Ef Shin comes to steal
dat yuther brat to-night, we got to fix him up so Shin
won’t find out de cub ain’t his’n.”</p>

<p>“I got plenty ragged clothes,” Whiffle replied.
“I’ll git you a full suit.”</p>

<p>“When is you leavin’ out fer de hog-camp,
Whiffle?” Skeeter asked as soon as the suit was
wrapped in a bundle.</p>

<p>“I’s gittin’ ready to walk right now,” Whiffle told
him.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a good idear to walk it,” Skeeter remarked.
“You kin take shawt cut-offs through de woods, an’
ef anybody is passin’ you kin hide in de grass so dey
cain’t see you is got little Shinny wid you.”</p>

<p>“It’s a powerful long walk,” Whiffle complained.
“But I guess I’m got to take it.”</p>

<p>“You kin come back in de mawnin’,” Skeeter
assured her, as he rose to go. “When Shin finds out
he’s made a miscue an’ stole de wrong chile, de Tickfall
niggers will buzz him till he leaves town fer
good.”</p>

<p>It was sundown when Skeeter got back to the
saloon, and he ate his supper and waited impatiently
until the darkness was heavy enough for him to venture
after Happy’s son. At last he slipped to her
cabin, lifted the laughing little fellow upon his shoulders,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
and carried him back to the rear room of his
saloon.</p>

<p>“Huh,” Skeeter grunted as he turned on the light
and surveyed the boy. “Happy shore has put de
paradise rags on Ready Rocket. He looks like a
valumtime. I don’t b’lieve he’ll feel half as comf’able
in dem gyarmints as he will in dese sensible
clothes.”</p>

<p>Then for the first time in his life Skeeter began to
undress a baby. His inexperienced hands were as
clumsy as if he wore boxing-gloves; he felt around
the garments for buttons and stuck pins in himself;
he unhitched parts of the little fellow’s harness and
found to his surprise that they were connected with
other parts of his clothes which apparently had no
way of being detached. The sweat popped out on
Skeeter’s face, his fingers trembled, and his lips were
drawn in a straight, nervous line.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” he sighed. “Dis is de hardest wuck I
ever done, an’ I ain’t done it yit. Dis job ain’t even
good started. It would take about fo’teen womans
to undress dis valumtime doll. I bet his maw melted
him in a cookin’ pot an’ poured him into dese clothes.”</p>

<p>He struggled on, jerking and pulling, but accomplishing
little. Then he straightened up and surveyed
his task.</p>

<p>“Ef I could button dem clothes on de way dey wus
at fust, I’d put little Shinny’s rags on over ’em,” he
announced to himself. Then he shook his head hopelessly.
“’Tain’t no use tryin’ dat. I gotter study
dis problem out an’ git dem bliss rags off!” He
turned the boy around to take a comprehensive survey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
of the mystery. Then he found a button in the
rear and undid it. The clothes fell off of little Ready
Rocket like the last leaf off of a tree, leaving the limbs
bare.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Skeeter snickered. “Ain’t dat
funny! Dis here is a one-button suit. You press de
button an’ lo an’ beholes!”</p>

<p>He looked the tiny black-skinned chunk of humanity
over. On Ready’s left arm he found an ugly
scar.</p>

<p>“Looks like a fresh vaccinate mark to me,” he
muttered. “I mighty nigh fergot whut Happy tole
me ’bout dat sore arm.”</p>

<p>He brought a bright red stick of candy out of his
pocket and placed it in Ready Rocket’s willing hand.</p>

<p>“Now, sonny,” he whispered. “You suck dat
sugar-stick an’ fergit dat I is changin’ yo’ clothes. I
cain’t handle dese city duds, but I knows how to put
on little Shinny’s overalls an’ shirt beca’se I wore dem
kind of drapery my own se’f.”</p>

<p>The little fellow murmured no complaint at the
operation except when Skeeter momentarily separated
his hand from his mouth and deprived him of his
sugar-stick. But Skeeter quickly made the proper
connection again, and when the child was dressed in
little Shinny’s old clothes, Skeeter tossed the glad
rags into a dark corner, lifted Ready in his arms, and
carried him out on the street.</p>

<p>“Now, sonny,” he said, as he placed Ready on the
ground, “us ’ll take a long, long walk!”</p>

<p>He started straight down the middle of the sandy
road, the little boy trotting beside him sucking his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
candy. A quarter of a mile had been covered in this
way when Ready Rocket dropped his candy.</p>

<p>“Ah-hah!” Skeeter said, as he picked up the sticky
candy, wiped a little of the sand and dust off it, and
stuck it back in Ready’s gaping mouth. “Dat’s a
good sign&mdash;you is gittin’ tired an’ sleepy.”</p>

<p>They turned around and started back toward the
saloon, Skeeter pressing the boy to walk as fast as he
could. Half a dozen times in the return walk the
little fellow dropped his candy and finally Skeeter
grew tired of Ready’s carelessness. He merely picked
up the sticky substance and helped Ready make
connection with his mouth and hand, without taking
the trouble to wipe off the dirt.</p>

<p>“Ef you git de colic eatin’ dat gorm of sugar an’
dirt, I hopes Shin Bone will hab you to wait on,”
Skeeter remarked to his charge. “I ain’t got no
expe’unce wid some yuther nigger’s stomick-ache.”</p>

<p>Within two blocks of the barroom, Ready’s little
feet stopped like a clock with a broken spring.
Skeeter dragged him for a few steps by the arm.
Then he lifted the sleeping child, carried him to a
ragged quilt in a corner of the rear room, and laid him
down. The child’s tiny hand still clutched the muddy
sugar-stick.</p>

<p>Skeeter entered the saloon and took his place
behind the bar to wait for Shin Bone. He did not
have long to wait, and when Shin Bone appeared
Skeeter gasped, and his hand slipped to the little
shelf under the bar where his automatic pistol rested.</p>

<p>Shin had been drinking heavily, but the liquor had
not made him noisy. He was extremely quiet. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
walked restlessly about the barroom with the prowling
movements of a cat, careful not to make a noise
with his feet as he staggered across the floor, answering
if spoken to in a whisper, and glancing nervously
around him all the time. The practised eyes of the
negroes recognized the signs of danger. They knew
Shin was out to kill. Some slipped away, and all the
others became perfectly quiet. They knew that a
loud laugh, the noise of an overturned chair, the breaking
of a glass, the clatter of a stick falling to the floor,
any of these things might start the drink-crazed negro
to shooting. Shin had not only never been drunk
before, but no one had ever seen him drinking. But
now no jungle beast was more dangerous.</p>

<p>Finally Shin walked straight up to Skeeter and
leaned against the bar.</p>

<p>“Skeeter, is you got my little boy?” he inquired
in a low tone with exaggerated courtesy.</p>

<p>“Dar’s a little pickaninny sleepin’ on a quilt in de
back room, Shin,” Skeeter answered uneasily.</p>

<p>“I wants him,” Shin remarked.</p>

<p>“He ain’t no kinnery of mine, Shin,” the barkeeper
retorted. “Ever who owns him kin hab him.”</p>

<p>“Dis here sinful saloom ain’t no fitten place fer my
angel chile,” Shin remarked in the same low, deadly
tone.</p>

<p>“His maw axed me to keep him, Shin,” Skeeter
said. “Of co’se, a daddy is got de fust right to his own
baby an’ I’s jes’ tryin’ to be friends on bofe sides.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t no friend of mine,” Shin told him
flatly. “I ain’t huntin’ no friends. I’s huntin’
revengeance!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>Shin walked away, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Skeeter listened and heard Shin stumble across
the floor in the rear room. With a loud grunt he
stooped over the soiled quilt where Ready Rocket
lay. With a louder grunt, he lifted the boy in his
arms, and Skeeter heard him stagger to the door
and close it quietly behind him.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Skeeter heard a loud wail down
the street, and broke into a broad grin.</p>

<p>“I reckin Shin is done fell on Ready Rocket an’
squshed him; mebbe he’s done squoze Ready’s sore
arm; mebbe Ready’s got de colics&mdash;I hopes so. I
hopes all dem things is come to pass.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About two hours after Shin Bone had taken his
departure with little Ready Rocket, Mustard Prophet
entered, looked around the barroom for a moment,
then came over to Skeeter Butts, and inquired:</p>

<p>“Whar is Ready Rocket?”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows,” Skeeter replied. “He has went.”</p>

<p>“Happy Rocket sont me to fetch him home,”
Mustard said. “She say it’s little Ready’s bedtime
an’ he’ll git sleepy.”</p>

<p>“My stars an’ garters!” Skeeter exclaimed. “She
don’t look fer dat brat home to-night, do she?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly. Whar is he at?”</p>

<p>Skeeter began to pant. He mopped the sweat
from his forehead and looked around him desperately.
His eyes lighted upon Pap Curtain.</p>

<p>“Come over dis way, Pap,” he called.</p>

<p>When Pap and Mustard stood side by side, Skeeter
leaned over the bar and said earnestly:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>“Pap, I want you an’ Mustard to keep bar fer me
till I git back.”</p>

<p>“Dat suits us!” the two darkies chanted.</p>

<p>“I’ll tend to little Ready Rocket, Mustard,”
Skeeter said as he reached for his derby hat.</p>

<p>As he passed out the two negroes looked at each
other and grinned.</p>

<p>“Skeeter’s done kotch de mattermony germ
agin,” Pap chuckled. “Tryin’ to hitch up wid
Happy Rocket an’ her whelp. Lawd! Think of
Skeeter marryin’ a widder an’ a ready-made fambly!”</p>

<p>Skeeter made a bee-line for Mustard Prophet’s
cabin where Mrs. Happy Rocket could be found.
But he had no matrimonial intentions.</p>

<p>“I jes’ drapped over to tell you ’bout little Ready
Rocket, Happy,” Skeeter began as soon as he was
seated. “Ready won’t be home to-night.”</p>

<p>“Won’t&mdash;<i>which</i>?” Happy’s voice was almost a
scream.</p>

<p>“Ready’s gwine lay out to-night,” Skeeter remarked
easily, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>“How come?” Happy wailed, and her voice had a
note of hysteria.</p>

<p>“It happened dis way,” Skeeter replied. “Ready
got a little sleepy an’ I spread him down a pallet on
de flo’ in de rear room. A drunk bum named Shin
Bone foun’ little Ready an’ thought it wus his own
chile, so he picked him up an’ toted him off!”</p>

<p>Skeeter didn’t see any actuating cause for what
followed this statement and the astounding result
gave him the supreme sensation of his life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Happy Rocket sprang to her feet, spun round
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
and round like a whirling dervish, tore at her hair,
then wrapped her long arms around her head and
screamed like a maniac!</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” Skeeter exclaimed. “Stop dat
yelpin’&mdash;you’s fetchin’ dat bawl too high! A police
will come an’ git you toreckly!”</p>

<p>“O my chile! my chile! my baby chile!” Happy
screamed, wringing her hands, walking up and down
the porch floor, and stopping her walk now and then
to spin around like a top. “Lawd hab mussy! My
onliest baby chile!”</p>

<p>“Aw, hush!” Skeeter pleaded, absolutely blind to
the distress of the woman. “You done mourned a
plenty ’bout dat little weanlin’. He ain’t nothin’ but
a two-year-ole!”</p>

<p>“Stole by a drunk man!” Happy whooped.
“Toted away! O my po’ little baby boy&mdash;he’ll be
kilt!”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter protested. “Shin won’t do
nothin’ like dat. Shin thinks dat is his boy. He’ll
fotch little Ready back as quick as he gits sober.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” Happy screamed, as she turned
from Skeeter and staggered into the house. “Oh!”</p>

<p>The agony in the mother’s voice caused Skeeter’s
hair to stand on end. Inside the room Happy fell
flat upon the floor unconscious.</p>

<p>“Gawd he’p us!” Skeeter screamed. “She’s done
throwed a fit!”</p>

<p>He called loudly for Hopey, Mustard Prophet’s
wife, then instantly remembered that she had not
yet come from the Gaitskill home where she was cook.
He started out of the door in a run to seek for help
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
and met Hopey at the gate. She had heard the
screams and had come in a panic.</p>

<p>Hopey was fat and spread out like a dumpling
soaked in gravy, and was sweating like an ice pitcher
from her excitement and exertion.</p>

<p>“Whut’s de matter, Skeeter Butts?” she howled.
“All dis flurry gibs me a toothache in my stomick.”</p>

<p>“Happy ain’t happy no more,” Skeeter lamented.
“She’s hacked!”</p>

<p>“Whut made her dis way?” Hopey panted, as she
bent over the young mother’s prostrate form.</p>

<p>“She got peeved up beca’se I borrered little Ready
Rocket an’ couldn’t fotch him back,” Skeeter explained.</p>

<p>“Go git him!” Hopey whooped. “Hurry befo’ dis
nigger woman dies!”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Skeeter grunted. “You ack like a little
nigger cub is wuth a millyum dollars!”</p>

<p>“Go git him!” Hopey howled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whar he am!” Skeeter retorted.
“Shin Bone swiped him!”</p>

<p>“You nachel-bawn, ignernunt <i>fool</i>!” Hopey
screamed. “Shin ain’t run off nowheres! I passed
de restaurant jes’ now an’ he wus settin’ in dar by
hisse’f singin’ religium toons! Go git Ready!”</p>

<p>Skeeter shot out of the door and ran across the
yard, but before he reached the street, Hopey bawled
atter him:</p>

<p>“When dis nigger woman comes outen her fit, I’s
gwine tell her all about dat plan you fixed up to make
Shin steal her darlin’ chile&mdash;an’ she’ll pull yo’ hind
leg off an’ beat yo’ brains out wid it!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>At the nearest corner Skeeter came to a quick stop.</p>

<p>“Ef Shin Bone is settin’ in his eatin’ house drunk
an’ singin’ religium toons, it’s a shore sign he’d shoot
me in a minute ef I tried to git dat Ready Rocket.”</p>

<p>He snatched off his hat, clawed at his thinly cropped
hair, and sighed like the exhaust of a steamboat.</p>

<p>“Ain’t I in a awful mess?” he panted. “I done
twisted an’ turned myse’f till I’s too crooked to walk
through a tunnel&mdash;when I die dey’ll hab to bury me
in a round hat box!”</p>

<p>He dropped down upon an old stump, and his nervous
feet beat a tattoo upon the sandy soil.</p>

<p>“I never knowed womans wus so crazy about deir
chillun befo’,” he exclaimed. “<i>My</i> mammy done los’
me out in de woods an’ Marse John Flournoy foun’
me in de swamp when I wus ’bout two year ole. He
tole me I wus plum’ naked, jes’ crawlin’ aroun’ in de
high marsh grass like a little lan’ tarrapin. Dat
don’t look like nigger mammies loved deir brats.
But den, dey done foun’ my mammy daid in anodder
part of de swamp. But dese here moderm niggers&mdash;lawd,
dey shore cherish spite!”</p>

<p>Suddenly a new thought galvanized him into
action.</p>

<p>“Dat’s de idear!” he proclaimed, springing to the
middle of the street and running at full speed. “I’ll
ride out to de hog-camp in de Little Moccasin Swamp
an’ make Whiffle Bone let me fotch back little Shinny
to his real paw. Den I’ll get Shin Bone to swap brats
wid me, an’ dat’ll make us even an’ end all dese
troubles.”</p>

<p>He ran through the crooked lanes of Dirty-Six like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
a brown shadow, passed with unchecked speed
through the portion of Tickfall occupied by the whites,
and began to pant up the long hill on the summit of
which stood the house of Sheriff John Flournoy.</p>

<p>Skeeter was perfectly at home here, for he lived in
a cabin in the rear of Flournoy’s house, and had done
just as he pleased about the place ever since Flournoy
had found him in the swamp, a little naked baby
crawling through the high marsh grass, mewing like a
little blind kitten. He hurried around the house to
the garage and opened the doors as noiselessly as he
could. He had determined to use a little runabout
which Flournoy kept for his fishing and hunting trips.
In this machine he could go to the hog-camp, get
Whiffle Bone’s baby, and return in a very short time.</p>

<p>He pushed the little runabout out of the garage,
pushed it down the hill in the rear of the house, cranked
it, sprang into the seat, and drove through a back
pasture, out of a gate, and onto the rear street. He
took one fearful look behind him and saw with gratification
that no light had flashed up in Flournoy’s
house to show that the occupants had been disturbed
by his intrusion upon the property.</p>

<p>Skeeter shot through the white portion of the town,
and turned into the lanes of Dirty-Six at a perilous
speed. His dilapidated machine was rattling and
squeaking a loud protest at every turn, but Skeeter
did not heed the warning.</p>

<p>Then as Skeeter passed Pap Curtain’s house, a tire
burst with a loud explosion, the runabout careened
perilously, and before Skeeter could stop, it leaped
from the road, crashed through Pap Curtain’s fence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
and came to a halt within a few steps of Pap’s porch.</p>

<p>In the silence which followed, Skeeter heard a
woman in Pap’s cabin whooping like a siren in a
fog.</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up!” Skeeter snapped. “You ain’t in no
danger. <i>I’s</i> de coon whut oughter be howlin’.”</p>

<p>He leaped out of the machine, snatched open the
tool box, wrenched off an extra tire from the rear of
the car and began to make repairs.</p>

<p>The door opened and Whiffle Bone stepped out
upon the porch!</p>

<p>“Bless gracious, Whiffle!” Skeeter exclaimed in a
glad voice, as he worked with furious haste adjusting
his new tire. “I thought you wus out at de hog-camp.
Whar is little Shinny Bone?”</p>

<p>This question started another series of howls, and
Skeeter had his tire fitted and was ready to crank his
car before Whiffle had calmed down to where she
could answer.</p>

<p>“Little Shinny has went!” Whiffle screamed. “I
decided not to go to de hog-camp beca’se it wus so
fur. I tried to keep little Shinny hid in dis cabin.
But Hopey Prophet an’ a nigger woman named
Happy comed here jes’ now, an’ Happy blacked my
eye an’ punched my face an’ hurt my feelin’s at some
yuther places an’ took little Shinny Bone away.
Dey said dey wus gwine keep him fer security till you
fotch back Ready Rocket! I woulder follered ’em,
but I wus skeart dey would kill me!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s good news, Whiffle!” Skeeter exclaimed as
he cranked his car, and sprang into the seat. “Keep
ca’m, an’ plug up de calliope! I’ll go git Ready
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Rocket an’ fetch little Shinny back in less’n a
minute!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I’ll git little Shinny fust,” Skeeter decided as he
shot down the street. He stopped his automobile a
block away from Mustard Prophet’s house, ran down
the street, and slipped into a little side yard by climbing
the fence.</p>

<p>Hopey and Happy were in the kitchen, and Skeeter
heard Hopey’s loud voice:</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no good fer you to howl, Happy. Skeeter
will fotch back yo’ little boy as quick as he kin git
him, an’ we done got dat yuther woman’s brat fer
s’curity.”</p>

<p>’“Tain’t nothin’ like habin’ yo’ own chile!” Happy
wailed.</p>

<p>“Hey!” Hopey bellowed. “Sup up dis hot tea
now an’ stop blubberin’!”</p>

<p>Skeeter had heard enough to know that the women
did not have the child in the kitchen with them. He
stepped around the house, tiptoed up to the porch,
and lo! the boy lay asleep upon the bed just inside
of the open door.</p>

<p>“Dat gits me straight in dis bizzness,” Skeeter
grinned, as he slipped into the room and lifted the
sleeping child. “I’m shorely got de Lawd wid me dis
time. Nobody cain’t git dis pickaninny away from me
widout plenty compelment!”</p>

<p>He deposited Shinny in the machine, spun down
the street to the Bone eating-house, and once more
stopped his car a block away.</p>

<p>“Shin’s got killin’ on de brain,” he muttered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
“I’s gwine spy aroun’ a little befo’ I crowds him too
close.”</p>

<p>Shin Bone was seated alone in the middle of his
restaurant which was lighted up like a circus. He
was lining out a church hymn, singing it at the top of
his voice, and beating the time with a large tin coffee
pot. He had pounded the table with his tin pot until
it was a certainty that it would never serve its original
purpose again.</p>

<p>“I guess little Ready is sleepin’ in de back room,”
Skeeter remarked, as he slipped around to the rear.</p>

<p>He entered the open door and found the child lying
upon the bed which was usually occupied by Shin
Bone’s real son. Carefully lifting the little fellow,
Skeeter walked quickly down the street, grinning
exultantly as he listened to Shin Bone’s raucous voice
singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O heaben’s mighty nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mighty nigh, mighty nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ef you got a eye fer visions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In de sky, in de sky!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When young Ready lay beside Shin Bone’s boy in
the automobile, Skeeter felt almost happy.</p>

<p>“It ’pears to me like I got dis job by de tail wid a
downhill pull!” he exulted, as he started his machine
and drove away from Dirty-Six with a lighter heart.</p>

<p>“I’se gwine take dese babies to my cabin,” he
decided. “Dem squallin’ womans kin wait fer deir
brats&mdash;dey don’t ’preciate whut I done fer ’em nohow.
But Marse John might git peeved up ef he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
missed dis automobile an’ I cain’t affode to git in no
lawsuit wid de cotehouse.”</p>

<p>Entering Sheriff John Flournoy’s yard, Skeeter
Butts drove his little rattling runabout up the asphalt
runway toward the garage in as nearly perfect silence
as he could command.</p>

<p>Quickly he dismounted and pushed the little machine
back where it belonged. Then he lifted the
sleeping children out of the machine and started
toward his own cabin.</p>

<p>Instantly a long shaft of white light shot across his
path and he scampered out of the way, hiding behind
some shrubbery which grew close to the house.
He looked down the runway and his hair stood on
end.</p>

<p>Flournoy’s big automobile was coming up the
drive, its powerful light turning from side to side,
illuminating every inch of the way. Skeeter did not
know what moment a turn of the wheel would cause
the light to flash across his body, so he slipped
along the side of the house out to the front.</p>

<p>Alas! Standing at the front gate where she had
just left the car was Mrs. Flournoy, and the electric
light upon the corner made the front lawn as bright
as day.</p>

<p>Skeeter noted that Mrs. Flournoy’s back was
turned to him, so he scampered up the front steps
and entered the front door just as Mrs. Flournoy
turned to come up the walk.</p>

<p>Flournoy never thought of locking his house for
the reason that half a dozen bloodhounds were running
at large on his lawn all the time. For a moment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
because of this fact, Skeeter had escaped observation.
What to do next was his problem.</p>

<p>The house was perfectly familiar to Skeeter. He
could have gone all over it with his eyes shut. And
he was perfectly welcome there night and day, for he
had been coming and going in that house for twenty-five
years with no one to question his actions. But
he had no desire to be caught in that house with two
strange babies in his arms!</p>

<p>The front door opened and Mrs. Flournoy entered,
snapping on the electric light in the reception-room.
Skeeter retreated to the dining-rooms still hugging
the two children in his wearying arms.</p>

<p>“Huh,” he muttered to himself. “Dese folks
always gits somepin to eat befo’ dey goes to bed.
I better git outen dis dinin’-room!”</p>

<p>He was just in time, too, for the doors to the
dining-room slid open just as Skeeter stepped into a
little back hall, which contained a narrow staircase
leading to the second story. Skeeter tiptoed up the
steps. His idea was to wait until the folks had
entered the dining-room, then go down the front
stairs, out of the front door and around to his
cabin.</p>

<p>But luck was against him!</p>

<p>At the top of the steps he paused to rest his arms
and get another grip upon the children he was carrying.
He laid the boys side by side, took one under
each arm like a bundle, and started on. Then it
happened. He attempted to enter a narrow door
and a little woolly nigger head hit the sharp edge of
the door jamb on each side with a thump!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>The two pickaninnies let out a howl which turned
Skeeter’s blood to ice water.</p>

<p>Any effort toward concealment was useless now,
and Skeeter was consumed with desire to get out of
that house. He galloped down the front steps,
turned into the rear hall, and stepped out upon a side
porch.</p>

<p>Sheriff John Flournoy met him at the steps!</p>

<p>Flournoy turned the electric flashlight he had
been using at the garage into Skeeter’s face, and the
blinded, terrified darky reeled backward and dropped
the two howling nigger babies upon the porch floor.</p>

<p>“Turn on the light, Skeeter!” Flournoy commanded.</p>

<p>Skeeter reached up above his head and switched
on an electric light suspended from a cord.</p>

<p>Flournoy looked down at the howling nigger babies
and grinned. He saw nothing unusual in the fact
that Skeeter was coming out of his home at eleven
o’clock at night, for Mrs. Flournoy had left Skeeter in
charge of the house a thousand times in their absence.
Nor did the two black babies excite anything more
than amusement, for several negro families lived on
his place and their cabins were full of children.</p>

<p>“Did you steal those nigger babies, Skeeter?”
Flournoy drawled in his easy, smiling way. The
remark was merely to make talk.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Skeeter stammered. “Naw, suh!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear you say that,” Flournoy chuckled.
“Since the Lamana kidnaping case, the Legislature
has passed a law making the penalty for stealing children
very severe in Louisiana.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>Skeeter attempted to moisten his parched lips with
a dry tongue. Then he asked through jaws which
felt like they were locked:</p>

<p>“Whut&mdash;whut&mdash;whut am de penalty, Marse
John?”</p>

<p>“<i>Death!</i>” the sheriff answered.</p>

<p>Then an oath of surprise popped from his throat.
Skeeter had crumpled like a broken weed and had
fallen face downward between the two squalling
black babies.</p>

<p>Flournoy leaped forward and turned the prostrate
man over on his back.</p>

<p>The negro had fainted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Flournoy appeared upon the side porch and
quieted the babies by the simple process of giving
each of them a piece of fried chicken.</p>

<p>Sheriff Flournoy as quickly restored Skeeter to
consciousness by pouring cold water on his head and
hot liquor down his throat.</p>

<p>Then leaving the babies to play under the electric
light upon the porch, they conducted Skeeter to the
kitchen and demanded explanations.</p>

<p>Nobody can beat a negro making explanations.</p>

<p>Skeeter’s statement was utterly untrue, but when
we remember that the frightened darky considered
that he had been guilty of the crime of kidnaping and
was hopefully attempting to save himself from the
penalty of death, all kind-hearted persons will forgive
him. Most of us would stretch the blanket just a
little if by doing so we could save our lives.</p>

<p>“It happened dis way, Marse John,” Skeeter said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
in a trembling voice. “I wus givin’ dem two little
black babies a little outin’, an’ I decided I would
fotch ’em up here an’ let ’em see whar I lived at. I’s
proud of dat little cabin whut you-all gib me, even ef
I do say it myse’f. I ain’t been feelin’ so powerful
well sence ’bout supper-time to-night&mdash;it muss had
been somepin I et&mdash;an’ passin’ de house I got to feelin’
powerful bad, an’ I decided I would git me some
medicine. I knowed you-all warn’t at home, but de
med’cine chist is right up-stairs whar it’s been fer
twenty year, so I wint up dar to git me some linimint
to rub on my misery. When I heerd the auto come
in, I comed down to ax Ole Miss whut to take, an’
when I wus talkin’ to you on de po’ch somepin jes’
nachelly happened!”</p>

<p>This sounded perfectly plausible to Skeeter’s two
white friends who did not have the least hint of the
mess he had mixed down in the negro settlement.</p>

<p>“You’d better go to bed, Skeeter,” Flournoy said
kindly. “I’ve seen niggers pull many different stunts
in my life, but you are the only darky I ever saw
all in a dead faint.”</p>

<p>“I been feelin’ kinder faint an’ feeble fer a good
while,” Skeeter moaned.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you some pills to take, Skeeter,” Mrs.
Flournoy said. “Go to your cabin, and if you are
not better in the morning we’ll have the doctor.”</p>

<p>Skeeter turned to her pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Whut is I gwine do wid dem two nigger babies?”
he asked. “I bet deir maws is bellerin’ fer ’em right
now like cows callin’ fer deir calves.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel strong enough to drive my little runabout,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
Skeeter?” Flournoy asked. “You can take
the babies home in that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Skeeter exclaimed eagerly. “I’s
strong enough to run it an’ de fresh air will do me
good.”</p>

<p>Flournoy pushed out the little machine, helped
Skeeter arrange the children so they would not
tumble out, cranked the car for the “sick” negro,
and for the second time that night the sheriff’s
little runabout started for Dirty-Six.</p>

<p>In the meantime things had been happening in
that negro settlement. The grapevine telephone
carried the news that Shin Bone had stolen Happy
Rocket’s baby. A little later the message ran along
the same mysterious channel that Happy Rocket
had stolen Shin Bone’s baby. Then the startling
information came that some party or parties unknown
had stolen Shin Bone’s baby out of Happy
Rocket’s cabin.</p>

<p>This was enough to bring the entire population
of Dirty-Six out of their cabins into the street. They
streamed up and down the narrow lanes, jabbering,
gesticulating, telling again and again of the fight between
Whiffle Bone and Happy Rocket, of the divorce
of Shin and Whiffle, of the drunken spree of Shin Bone.</p>

<p>The general idea prevailed that Shin Bone had
possession of both babies, but no one cared to go
and inquire while Shin was crazy drunk, singing
“heavy religion” songs, and pounding the table with
a tin coffee pot.</p>

<p>Then Whiffle Bone caused a sensation by leaving
her uncle Pap Curtain’s cabin and running down the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
street toward the Bone eating-house squalling like a
catamount. Dozens of negroes fell into her wake and
followed at a safe distance.</p>

<p>As they approached the restaurant they all recognized
with pleasure that Shin Bone was sobering up.
The best indication of this improvement was the
character of songs he was singing. He had abandoned
the heavy religion tunes, his voice had lost some
of its volume, and the music was gay and lightsome:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“De boss he squall to de nigger boys:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">‘Don’t bother dat jug in de spring!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De jug he gurgle out: ‘Good, good, good!’<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But me, I holler an’ sing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘O gimme dat gal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De big, greasy gal&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don’t nobody bother dat sway-backed Sal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who wrops up her hair wid a string!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whiffle Bone threw open the door of the eating-house,
ran across the sanded floor, threw herself into
Shin Bone’s outstretched arms, and broke into his
song with a loud wail:</p>

<p>“O Shin, I loves you wid all my heart! Less don’t
fuss no more&mdash;I’ll ’vide up de money even! An’ fer
Gawd’s sake, come an’ he’p me find little Shinny, our
darlin’, angel chile!”</p>

<p>“Don’t pester yo’ mind ’bout our angel chile,” Shin
Bone vociferated, pounding the table with the battered
coffee pot. “I fotch him home from de Hen-Scratch&mdash;he
layin’ in de back room in his own little
bed!”</p>

<p>Placing his coffee pot under his arm, he led his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
sobbing, hysterical wife into the back room and then
stood gazing in pop-eyed, drunken amazement at the
empty bed.</p>

<p>“Whar is he at? Oh, whar is he <i>at</i>?” Whiffle
screamed.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought I toted him home, Whiffle!” Shin
Bone said in a hysterical tone. “I wonder did I
drap him down a well&mdash;or somepin like dat?”</p>

<p>This suggestion threw Whiffle into a maniacal
frenzy and administered such a shock to Shin Bone
that it sobered him completely in a moment.</p>

<p>“Come on, squall-cat!” he bellowed. “Less go
to de Hen-Scratch an’ ax Skeeter Butts ’bout dis!”</p>

<p>When they arrived at the saloon they found a dense
crowd of negroes within the place listening to the
whoops and howls of Happy Rocket and Hopey
Prophet, both of whom had also come to the saloon to
interrogate Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>When Shin and his wife entered they occupied the
opposite end of the barroom, and then began an antiphonal
chorus between the two bereaved parties
which was better as a show to the bystanders than a
zoo full of ring-tailed monkeys.</p>

<p>Finally all their wails became focalized into one
hysterical appeal:</p>

<p>“Where, oh, where is Skeeter Butts gone at?”</p>

<p>When Skeeter spun around the corner and looked
up the street at the crowd assembled around his
place of business, he availed himself of benefits of
that intolerable nuisance called the muffler cut-out,
and drew up to his saloon and stopped his car, popping
like a battle of rapid-fire guns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p>A man-sized voice at the door bawled the information
to the people in the saloon:</p>

<p>“Here comes Skeeter Butts in Sheriff John Flournoy’s
ought-to-be-a-mule!” A moment later he
bawled another announcement: “Skeeter’s got the
two lost babies wid him!”</p>

<p>In a moment more Skeeter was pushing and shoving
at the door, while his voice cackled like a hen:</p>

<p>“Git out de way an’ lemme pass! Lemme git in
wid dese here stole babies!”</p>

<p>They made a ring around him in the middle of the
room as he placed the two grinning, bright-eyed
children on the floor at his feet. Each baby was
happily chewing a chicken bone. The two mothers
rushed forward to embrace their children, but Skeeter’s
commanding voice cracked like a bull-whip:</p>

<p>“Stan’ back, nigger womans! Don’t tech dem
brats till I gib de word!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of intense silence while
Skeeter gathered his wits to speak. No one in that
crowd will ever know how frightened the little barkeeper
was, nor how desperate. He had determined
to risk his life and liberty upon the magic name of
John Flournoy, Sheriff of Tickfall parish.</p>

<p>If this name failed to save him, he saw nothing
before him but the prison and the hangman’s noose.</p>

<p>“I been talkin’ to Sheriff John Flournoy,” he began.
“Me an’ Marse John is kinnery&mdash;I’m his folks.”</p>

<p>He paused and took out his handkerchief, mopping
his face. He felt like every pore of his skin was
a spouting fountain of perspiration and he was sweating
ice water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>“I went up to Marse John’s house an’ tole him dat
Shin Bone stole little Ready Rocket outen my saloon,
an’ Marse John mighty nigh bust out cryin’! I tole
him dat Happy Rocket stole little Shinny Bone right
outen his mammy’s arms, an’ Marse John jes’
blubbered right out like a little baby!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see nothin’ so powerful bad!” Shin Bone
interrupted.</p>

<p>“My Gawd, Shin!” Skeeter exclaimed with all the
dramatic force of his nature. “Marse John says he
ain’t had to hang no nigger sence he’s been a sheriff,
but de law specifies dat <i>de penalty fer stealin’ a baby
is death</i>!”</p>

<p>If Skeeter hoped to make a sensation, he did!</p>

<p>Whiffle Bone threw her arms around her husband’s
neck and sobbed as if he were already dead.</p>

<p>Happy Rocket dropped upon her knees upon the
barroom floor, raised her quivering hands in an attitude
of prayer and sobbed:</p>

<p>“O mussiful Gawd! I’s a mean, wuthless nigger
an’ I ain’t prepared to die!”</p>

<p>“Looky here, Skeeter!” Shin Bone howled in a
desperate, frightened voice. “Didn’t you steal dem
babies yo’ own se’f? How come you is got ’em wid
you ef you didn’t steal ’em?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh!” Skeeter Butts squealed. “I attached
dem chillun in de name of de law an’ de sheriff
an’ de Nunited States of Loozanny!”</p>

<p>Then Shin Bone broke down and howled:</p>

<p>“Gimme my baby! Me an’ Whiffle is gwine leave
dis town till atter de gram-jury meets!”</p>

<p>“Take him!” Skeeter exclaimed. “I don’t want
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
him&mdash;I’d druther hab a yeller-jacket under my shirt.
Jes’ take yo’ brat an’ go!”</p>

<p>“Gimme my baby!” Happy screamed. “I’se
gwine back home to-night on de fust train!”</p>

<p>“Honey, don’t let nothin’ detain you!” Skeeter
admonished her. “I don’t want yo’ baby&mdash;I’d
druther hab a cockle-bur in my sock. Jes’ take yo’
brat an’ go!”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the barroom was empty, the crowd
splitting into two parts, following either Happy
Rocket or Shin Bone home, according to their sympathies.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor Skeeter found a tin
coffee pot. It was battered, broken, and useless,
and one side was caved in until it resembled a big,
toothless mouth grinning at him in sardonic glee.
He bent over it, examined it from all sides, but did
not touch it. The mishaps of the night had made
him cowardly.</p>

<p>“Nigger luck is always bad luck,” he whispered.
“Dis here tin pot might be a bomb an’ bust right in
my face. I’ll let Little Bit pick it up when be cleans
up in de mawnin’. All dis night bad luck has kotch
me befo an’ behime&mdash;mostly behime.”</p>

<p>Skeeter sat down to rest his mind and collect his
impressions. He was not the jaunty, confident,
debonair young man he had been a few hours before.
He felt like something had gone out of him, fading
like breath upon a razor, leaving him but a shell of
his former self, never to recover what he had lost and
be the same again.</p>

<p>Tears of weakness and nervous collapse came into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
his eyes and rolled down his cheeks to the corners of
his mouth. He wiped them away with the palm of
his yellow hand and spoke again:</p>

<p>“One time when I wus little I axed Marse John
Flournoy whar I come from. He tole me dat a buzzard
laid me an’ de debbil hatched me in de hot ashes.
I don’t misdoubt dem words, because I been ketchin’
hell ever since!”

Skeeter Butts proclaimed as he sat under the shade
of a chinaberry tree in the rear of the Hen-Scratch
saloon.</p>

<p>“Mebbe so,” the glib-talking man beside him
said; “but dis here ain’t no highbrow book. It tells
all ’bout whut dreams means. Don’t you never
dream nothin’?”</p>

<p>“Shore!” Skeeter exclaimed, clawing at a high,
white collar which threatened to saw his head off.
“Las’ night I dreamt dat I done died an’ went to de
bad place.”</p>

<p>“Dar now!” his friend exclaimed, turning the
pages of the book until he found the word “Hell.”
“You listen to dis.” Then, with the utmost difficulty
the darky read: “‘To dream of seein’ hell denotes
dat de dreamer’s life is a bad one, an’ is an in-ti-ma-tion
to him of re-for-ma-tion.’”</p>

<p>“My gosh!” Skeeter Butts exclaimed, his eyes
nearly popping out of his head. “Dat shore hit me
right in de center of myse’f. How do dat book
know?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” the negro answered. “I s’pose it’s
inspired. Anyways, it don’t never miss nothin’.
Is you had any mo’ dreams recent?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter said, with a frightened expression
on his saddle-colored face. “Night befo’ las’ I
dreamed dat I wus up in a balloom.”</p>

<p>“Us’ll see whut dat means,” his friend exclaimed,
fumbling with the book. “Here it am: ‘Balloom&mdash;To
dream of it shows dat you will engage in many chi-mer-i-cal
plans.’”</p>

<p>“Engage in&mdash;<i>which</i>?” Skeeter demanded in a
startled tone.</p>

<p>“Chi-mer-i-cal,” the negro repeated with difficulty.
“Dat’s de kind it specify&mdash;Gawd knows whut dat
means.”</p>

<p>“How many of dem dreams comes true?” Skeeter
asked uneasily, gazing at the gaudy red cover of the
book.</p>

<p>“All of ’em,” his companion answered promptly.
“A garntee goes wid de book. Try it on wid anodder
dream.”</p>

<p>Skeeter hesitated a moment, thinking heavily.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“’Bout a week ago I dreamed ’bout rats.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the other darky grunted as he found the
place in the book. “Here am de word: ‘Rats&mdash;Se-cret
en-e-mies.’”</p>

<p>“Looky here, nigger!” Skeeter Butts exclaimed in
a frightened voice as he sprang to his feet, “dat
shore is a dangersome book. Put all dem dreams
togedder an’ look whut sort of a prize-package I done
drawed!”</p>

<p>“Dat package shore is got some lemons in it fer
you, Skeeter,” his friend assured him. “De fust
dream says dat yo’ life am bad an’ you oughter git
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
reformed; de second dream specify dat you is gwine
engage in&mdash;in&mdash;whut-you-call-it plans; de las’ dream
orate dat you got plenty enemies!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de way it goes,” Skeeter mourned.</p>

<p>“Does you want a garntee dat all ’em dreams will
come true?”</p>

<p>“Naw!” Skeeter howled. “I wants a garntee
dat none of ’em gits to come to pass.”</p>

<p>He snatched a package of cigarettes out of his
pocket, lighted one with trembling fingers, burned it
to his lips with furious puffs, and spat the stub out
upon the ground. Then he exhaled an immense
volume of smoke around his head, as if invoking
protective incense from the depths of his lungs.</p>

<p>“How much do dat book cost?” Skeeter finally
asked.</p>

<p>“One dollar,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Make it fo’ bits an’ I’ll buy de book,” Skeeter
told him.</p>

<p>“I cain’t do it, Skeeter,” the other darky responded.
“I needs a dollar. Excusin’ dat, a nigger
whut ain’t willin’ to pay one roun’ dollar to learn
how much bad luck is gwine git him deserves to hab
a few mo’ bad dreams.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Skeeter sighed as he laid a silver
dollar on his companion’s knee and reached out his
hand for the volume.</p>

<p>“I hates to part wid dis book, Skeeter,” his friend
said, as he reluctantly handed it over. “It shore is a
wonder book. I been readin’ atter it fer mighty nigh
a year. One dream I had specify dat somebody wus
gwine inherit me money!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>“I might could stan’ dat kind of a dream,” Skeeter
said in a solemn tone of voice. “But I’s gwine
roost powerful low fer a little while till I kin change
dem bad dreams I’m had to good ones.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de rule,” the other darky chuckled, as he
pocketed the dollar and rose to leave. “Ef dat book
says, ‘Lay low,’ you done got yo’ ordahs. Ef it tells
a rabbit to climb a tree, Br’e’r Rabbit had better hunt
a easy one to git up on an’ straddle a limb.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell nobody dat I done bought dis book,
pardner,” Skeeter begged. “I wants to gib it a good
try-on fust.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t say nothin’,” the darky grinned as he
started away. “Dis dollar will gib me a trip to N’
Awleens on de steamboat, an’ I’s gwine to de landin’
right now.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the man had gone Skeeter laid the book
aside, and busied himself in cleaning the saloon, wiping
off the bar and the tables and sweeping the room.
He tried to take his mind off of the book, but the
interpretations of his dreams constantly recurred to
his mind, and he felt a growing uneasiness.</p>

<p>“I wonder who dem secret enemies is,” he sighed.
“Dat book oughter had tole me mo’ ’bout dat.”</p>

<p>He counted off upon his fingers all the negroes
whom he did not like; then he counted those whom
he knew did not like him; then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Dat don’t he’p me none. Ef I knows deir names,
of co’se dey ain’t really secret enemies!”</p>

<p>He sat down at a table, lighted another cigarette,
let the hot ash fall from the end and set his trousers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
afire. Then he dropped his smoke, put out the fire,
and viewed the damage with popping eyeballs.</p>

<p>“Dat’s a <i>bad</i> sign,” he exclaimed. “A nigger
ain’t in luck whut sets his pants on fire!”</p>

<p>He got up and walked toward the rear exit of the
saloon, traveling with jerky, nervous steps, and looking
behind him twice with a frightened glance. He
seated himself again in the shade of the chinaberry
tree, and the book lay upon the chair which his friend
had vacated.</p>

<p>Skeeter eyed the volume a long time with increasing
uneasiness. The gaudy red-cover design represented
a red woman, propped up on some red pillows,
asleep, and holding a red fan in her hand. In the
background was another red woman waving a wand,
and a winged white boy, holding a black hat in one
hand and a bag of money in the other. Scattered
about on the red woman’s red couch were playing
cards, envelopes, and one square piece of paper which
contained the numbers, “4-11-44.”</p>

<p>“I onderstan’s dem numbers,” Skeeter mumbled
to himself. “Whar is 7-11?”</p>

<p>Skeeter lighted another cigarette and puffed it
furiously. Twice he reached out his hand to take
the book, then drew back without touching it. He
looked away several times, but the gaudy cover
design attracted him each time with a sort of hypnotic
fascination.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t oughter bought dis book,” he sighed.
“A nigger ain’t in luck ef he knows too much about
his innards.”</p>

<p>Finally he overcame his fear to the point where he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
ventured to turn the cover, and lo! on the other side
was the picture of an aged negro, his black face
framed in white hair and beard, his spectacles pushed
up on his flat forehead, his mouth spread wide in a
snaggle-toothed laugh.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Skeeter exclaimed, springing to his
feet and gazing at the face with a fear which made
his lips tremble, and his hands shake, and his knees
knock together. “Dar’s a tintype of ol’ Swampo,
dat wild Affican nigger whut used to live in a holler
sycamo’ tree in de Little Moccasin Swamp!”</p>

<p>He sat down, resting his elbows on his knees and his
face in his hands. For five minutes he strove to
recall all that he knew and had heard of Swampo.</p>

<p>He remembered the leering, leathery, wrinkled
face of the old half-wit negro, who came to town on
every Saturday afternoon, and smirked and bowed
and scraped around the white folks, holding out a
clawlike hand, begging for a few pennies. Once he
had heard a fearful screaming among the blue jays
in the swamp, and had crept through the high undergrowth
to see what the trouble was; and lo! Swampo
had caught a blue jay, had laid the bird on its back,
and had pinioned its wings to the ground with forked
sticks.</p>

<p>The bird’s horrible screams had brought all the
jays in that part of the swamp to the spot, and they
stood around the imprisoned bird, making loud and
profane comments upon his unfortunate predicament.
At intervals some blue jay, impelled by curiosity,
walked up within reach of the captive bird’s
claws. Instantly the captive reached out, seized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
the bird, and held him a prisoner until Swampo slunk
out of the underbrush, grinning like an ape, and
released it!</p>

<p>As he thought about this fearful scene, Skeeter’s
hair stood up on end, just as it had years before when
he witnessed it, and had crawled, terrified, away
from that vicinity. A cold shiver passed over his
sweat-drenched body; he raised his head and eyed
Swampo’s wide, laughing mouth with superstitious
awe.</p>

<p>“Swampo shore is got de laugh on me,” he muttered
through chattering teeth. “I wish dat nigger hadn’t
sold me dis book. I ain’t no scholard!”</p>

<p>Lighting one cigarette after another to bolster up
his courage, he managed at last to put out a trembling
finger and turn the book over so he could read the
title-page. With the greatest difficulty he spelled it
out, giving the peculiar negro pronunciation to the
words as he uttered them:</p>

<p>“‘Af-ric-an Dream Book an’ Fortune Teller, containin’
de true in-ter-pre-ta-tion of dreams, an’ de
numbers of de events to which dey ap-ply. Also
prog-nos-ti-ca-tions an’ di-vi-na-tions by cards, dice,
do-mi-noes, dreams, moles, an’ marks, phy-si-og-no-my,
phy-si-ol-o-gy, signs, au-gu-ri-es, charms, an’
in-can-ta-tions&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My good gosh!” Skeeter almost screamed as he
sprang to his feet. “Dis is a awful book! Half dem
words don’t signify nothin’!”</p>

<p>For ten minutes he walked up and down under
the trees muttering to himself, his face fear-stricken,
his hands trembling, his body oozing with cold sweat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>Then with a mighty resolution he reached out for
the book, folded it, and slipped it into his hip pocket.</p>

<p>“Dis book is done skeart me plum’ to death,” he
sighed. “Ef I die, I’ll go to hell! I wonder whar
Revun Vinegar Atts is at? I’s gwine to talk dis over
wid some religium pusson!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rev. Vinegar Atts occupied four chairs under
a tree in front of the Shoofly church&mdash;his body on
one, his feet on another, his arms spread wide across
the back of two more.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Skeeter?” he exclaimed. “Fotch you out
anodder chair from de chu’ch. I needs all I’m got.”</p>

<p>Skeeter looked him over and grinned. For a moment
he forgot his fears in contemplation of this squat-legged,
pot-bellied, moon-faced negro preacher, whose
head was bald except for two tufts of hair, one over
each ear, which made him resemble a mule wearing
a blind bridle.</p>

<p>“You shore is spreadin’ yo’se’f out, Elder,” Skeeter
said, as he set his chair close beside Vinegar. “You
look like a buzzard whut is tryin’ to fly back’ards an’
upside down at de same time.”</p>

<p>“I’s like a watermillyum vine,” Vinegar boomed.
“When I gits sot good, I begins to spraddle.”</p>

<p>Skeeter reached to his hip pocket and brought out
his dream book.</p>

<p>“Whut you flashin’ dat book aroun’ fer, Skeeter?”
Atts asked suspiciously. “De Bible say dat many
study is weary on de flesh.”</p>

<p>“I needs some advices from a scholard,” Skeeter
remarked as he lighted a cigarette. “I done smoked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
up a whole pack of dese here things in de las’ half-hour.
I’s powerful worrited in my mind.”</p>

<p>“You done come to de right place fer advices,
son,” Atts announced with confidence. “Ef you got
anything to ax me, jes’ bawl out!”</p>

<p>“Does you b’lieves in dreams, Elder?” Skeeter
began.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, dat depen’s,” Rev. Vinegar Atts
announced after a moment of cogitation. “As a
preacher, of co’se, I b’lieves in Proverdunce; but
ef you ’terrogates me jes’ as a common cullud nigger
pusson&mdash;of co’se dat’s plum’ diffunt.”</p>

<p>“Is you had any dreams recent?” Skeeter inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; I dreamt about a wash-tub las’ night,”
Vinegar informed him.</p>

<p>“Dis book tells whut dat dream signify,” Skeeter
explained, as he opened the volume and turned to the
proper page. “I reads dis about tubs: ‘Ef it be
filled wid water, you hab evil to fear; an empty tub
signify trouble; an’ to run against one, sorrow.’”</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Vinegar bawled.</p>

<p>With a convulsive movement of his body, he
kicked the chair from under his feet, hurled the chairs
from under his arms, and upset himself falling over
on his back with his feet in the air like an overturned
bug.</p>

<p>He jumped up, breathing like a foundered horse.</p>

<p>“Fear, trouble, an’ sorrer!” he bellowed. “I
knowed it! I knowed it wus comin’ on all de time!”</p>

<p>He sat down, folded his hands, and gazed around
him, his mouth hanging open like the jaws of a bull
alligator.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>“Here I is, Luck!” he mourned. “Jes’ come right
along, throw me down, an’ set on my head, den gimme
a dose of bumpo-calomel an’ lemme die! O
Lawdy, dat dose of dreams is shore heavy on dis
nigger’s stomick!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s pretty servigerous, Vinegar,” Skeeter said
mournfully, “but you oughter hear whut dis book
prophesy ’bout me!”</p>

<p>“Go ’way, little yeller nigger!” Vinegar exclaimed
with a flapping motion of his hand toward
Skeeter. “Don’t tell me nothin’ ’bout yo’se’f!
Ain’t I got all I kin stan’ right now? Look at me&mdash;I’s
skeart already; I’s got plenty trouble right dis
minute; an’ as fer sorrer&mdash;I’s shore sorry you ever
fetch yo’ ole yeller mug up on dis hill whar I sets!”</p>

<p>“Whut you gwine do, Elder?” Skeeter inquired
in a voice which quavered with fear.</p>

<p>“I’s gwine hide out till dese here calamities is done
passed over,” Vinegar bellowed.</p>

<p>He jerked out a soiled white handkerchief and
mopped it around his face, backward across the top
of his bald head, and over the back of his bull-like
neck.</p>

<p>“Whoosh!” he snorted. “I’ll be skeart to eat my
vittles! I’ll be skeart to go to bed at night! I
ain’t gwine take no chances wid a dream like dat
taggin’ behime me!”</p>

<p>Skeeter fumbled with the volume a moment, then
inquired:</p>

<p>“Would you wish to own dis book?”</p>

<p>“Who? Me?” Vinegar howled. “Naw, <i>suh</i>!
Whut a nigger don’t know cain’t never hurt him; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
ef he knows whut’s gwine to happen, he ain’t never
real sapisfied till it comes to pass.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Skeeter mourned. “I shore made
a miscue when I paid a dollar fer dis book. It’s got a
tintype of ole Affican Swampo in it&mdash;you rickoleck
him, Elder?”</p>

<p>“I shore does,” Vinegar responded. “De white
folks found him dead out in de Little Moccasin Swamp
wid a live rattlesnake in his hand!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s him,” Skeeter said fearfully. “I
had done fergot ’bout dat snake.”</p>

<p>“Atter dey kilt de snake de white folks foun’ dat
Swampo wus holdin’ it so tight in his dead han’ dat
dey couldn’t git it away from him,” Vinegar said.
“Dey buried Swampo an’ de snake togedder!”</p>

<p>“Listen to dat!” Skeeter exclaimed, his hair standing
up on his head. “Ain’t dat plum’ awful?”</p>

<p>“Whut dey doin’ wid Swampo’s picture in dat
book?” Vinegar wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Dis book is named atter Swampo,” Skeeter
informed him. “It’s called de Affican Dream Book.”</p>

<p>“Go ’way wid dat book, Skeeter!” Vinegar
bawled. “O Lawdy, I wonder whar I kin borry a
rabbit foot at?”</p>

<p>He sprang up, began to search his pockets, and
announced tragically:</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no luck-charms but a buckeye, a raw
pertater, de toof of a hoss, an’ de foot of a mud-turkle!”</p>

<p>Then happening to glance down to where a road
ran around the foot of the hill on which the church
was located, he waved his arms wildly and bellowed:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>“Hey, Figger Bush! Come over here a minute!
Come prompt, cullud man!”</p>

<p>Figger looked up, vaulted the churchyard fence,
and came up the hill toward them, wading through
weeds shoulder high.</p>

<p>“Don’t you say nothin’ ’bout dat book till I
borrers his rabbit foot, Skeeter!” Vinegar admonished
in a low tone as the two watched Figger’s
approach.</p>

<p>A moment later, Vinegar said:</p>

<p>“Figger, ain’t you got no luck-charms or rabbit
foots dat you kin loant me fer a little while?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Figger grinned. “Dey don’t do no good.
I done tried ’em out!”</p>

<p>“Does you believe in dreams, Figger?” Skeeter
asked after the three had seated themselves.</p>

<p>“Shore!” Figger answered, “I dreamed ’bout a
rabbit las’ night. De Revun is done reminded my
mind by axin’ ’bout my rabbit foot.”</p>

<p>“I’s gwine tell you whut dat dream means, Figger,”
Skeeter announced, looking at his book.
“‘Rabbit&mdash;To dream of a rabbit denotes some bad
accidunt.’”</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a goose sitting in a summer
shower when a big drop of rain hits him on the top
of his head? A whitish film comes over his eyes, he
looks up at the sky with a ludicrous appearance of
meekness and humble supplication, then ducks his
head beneath his wing and waits for the worst to
happen.</p>

<p>When this appalling interpretation of his dream
struck Figger on the top of his head he looked up at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the sky with filmed eyes, then walked to the middle
of the churchyard and stood upright with legs as
wabbly as those of a new-born calf.</p>

<p>“Fetch me a chair out here, Skeeter,” he howled.
“Don’t make me stan’ up any longer&mdash;I mought fall
over an’ bust my head or somepin. I’s gwine set out
from under dat tree! Set down in dat chair, Skeeter,
an’ see ef it is solid&mdash;it might break down an’ run one
of dem spokes clean through me.”</p>

<p>Skeeter tested the chair, and Figger sank down
upon it with an air of thankfulness. Then he sighed:</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t had walked through dem high weeds
comin’ up here&mdash;I bet dar is a snake in dem weeds as
long as a railroad track!”</p>

<p>Thus, in one minute, Figger Bush had reduced
himself to a hopeless imbecile. The other two looked
upon him with pity and compassion, trembling at the
dire portent of their own dreams and entering into
full fellowship of sympathy with Figger. They sat
for a few minutes in silence, then Skeeter Butts
announced:</p>

<p>“I reckin I better mosey back to de Hen-Scratch.”</p>

<p>“Us is gwine wid you, Skeeter,” the other two
announced promptly. “We is all sons of sorrer, an’
we oughter stick togedder.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the Hen-Scratch saloon they found Hitch Diamond,
Prince Total, and Pap Curtain.</p>

<p>“Whut ails you-alls?” Hitch inquired curiously as
he gazed into the frightened faces of his three friends.
“You niggers look like you is jes’ foun’ out you wus
borned to die!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack, Hitch,” Skeeter sighed, as he and
his two companions seated themselves on a bench.
“Us is all had bad dreams.”</p>

<p>“I had a dream las’ night,” Hitch announced in
his deep, rumbling bass. “I dreamed I runned a
donkey down an’ tied him to a tree, an’ he brayed all
night. Dat dream woked me up an’ I like to never
got to sleep no more.”</p>

<p>“Does you know whut dat dream means?” Skeeter
asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, it’s been worritin’ me all day.”</p>

<p>“Dis book tells whut dreams means, Hitch,”
Skeeter exclaimed as he opened the pages.</p>

<p>The negroes bunched up close around him, and
after a moment Skeeter found the place and read
aloud:</p>

<p>“‘Donkey&mdash;If you see him runnin’, brings misfortune;
if he is tied you will ex-per-i-ence great
loss; if you hear him bray, signifies death.’”</p>

<p>As Hitch Diamond received this intelligence he
was a study for the psychologist. His iron features
seemed to disintegrate, becoming a heterogeneous
mass of conflicting emotions; his giant form seemed
to shrink until his garments became too large, and
hung loose and flapped around him; his scalp moved,
forming a wedge on the top of his head, the point of
the wedge at the apex of his skull.</p>

<p>“Oh, swelp me!” Hitch mourned. “I shore hab
put up a job on myse’f dis time!”</p>

<p>The negroes gazed upon him with mournful curiosity,
but none offered encouragement or sympathy.
The fear of the unknown had gripped them all. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
the blazing heat of the mid-afternoon, few living
things were stirring, and an unearthly stillness
seemed to pervade the entire town of Tickfall. In
that vast silence of sun-slashed sky, and drooping,
withering earth, and quiet animate life, these six men
sat, filled with superstitious awe, appalled by fear
of the unknowable, confidently anticipating the very
worst of misfortune.</p>

<p>After a long time, Pap Curtain began to fidget.</p>

<p>“Say, Skeeter,” he whispered, “I don’t hanker
atter no trouble, but I dreamed ’bout a cart las’
night. I’s jes’ bound to know whut dat means.
See if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His whisper ended in a gasp as Skeeter began to
turn the pages of the mysterious book with nervous,
shaking fingers.</p>

<p>Pap waited, a picture of fear. His long neck rising
from his collarless shirt seemed to stretch longer; his
mouth, naturally so wide that one could sling a side
of bacon into it, hung open loosely, and moisture
appeared upon his cracked lip which retained a
habitual sneer; his large, shifty eyes rolled back in
his head like the eyes of a choking horse; then Skeeter
pronounced his doom:</p>

<p>“Here ’tis,” Skeeter said, in a voice which sounded
unnaturally loud, and which made every listener
jump. “‘Cart&mdash;Its ap-pear-ance indicates ser-i-ous
in-ju-ry. If you go upon it or move from it, de
in-ju-ry may prove fat-al.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawd, ain’t I a fool nigger?” Pap mourned.
“I wish I hadn’t ast nothin’ ’bout dat. I wus feelin’
powerful good up to now, but&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>He wiped the sweat from his face on his ragged
shirt-sleeve, reached back and jerked a twist of
perique chewing-tobacco from his hip-pocket, bit off
a chew, and promptly spat it out on the ground with
an exclamation of fear.</p>

<p>“I fergot, fellers!” he sighed. “Dat book specify
serious injury. Dis terbaccer mought hab a dynamite
cap wrapped up in it, an’ when I chaws dat cap
de top of my head will be over yanside de Massassap’
River!”</p>

<p>He held the twist off at arm’s length, slowly released
his fingers, and let it fall to the ground.</p>

<p>“Hey!” Hitch Diamond bellowed, flinching away.
“Don’t git so brash all of a suddent&mdash;be keerful how
you drap things aroun’ me! I done heerd a donkey
bray, an’ dat shore signify death!”</p>

<p>Prince Total got up, walked with jerky steps like a
string-halt horse into the saloon, and exercising the
right of assistant bar-tender, helped himself to a
liberal drink of red liquor; thus fortified, he came out
and sat down again. He opened his mouth to speak
several times, then closed it without a word. He was
aching to know the interpretation of his last dream but
dared not ask.</p>

<p>“Wus you aimin’ to ax somepin, Prince?” Skeeter
finally inquired in a lugubrious tone.</p>

<p>Prince shook his head, and Skeeter took out a buckeye
and began to shine it up by rubbing it upon the
leg of his trousers. At last, when Prince could stand
the suspense no longer, he asked in a feeble voice:</p>

<p>“Skeeter, I don’t hanker to wish no bad luck onto
myse’f, but, please, suh, look an’ see do de book say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
anything about a wheel? I seed a wheel in my sleep
las’ night.”</p>

<p>“Here ’tis,” Skeeter replied promptly. “Down
close to de eend of de list. ‘Wheel--Is om-i-nous of
evil.’”</p>

<p>“Dar now, Prince, you done got yourn,” Hitch
Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p>“I knowed it wus somepin bad,” Prince remarked
in a weak voice. “Nothin’ good don’t never happen
to a nigger!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts dropped the book upon the ground,
and it fell open with the laughing face of the gray-haired
negro exposed to the view of the men sitting
around him.</p>

<p>“Dat Swampo wus in cahoots wid de debbil,
fellers,” Hitch remarked in a low tone, as he pointed
to the picture. “He wus always potterin’ aroun’ wid
buzzards an’ sich like. He teached me a song ’bout de
turkey-buzzard when I wus jes’ a little shaver. It
went like dis:”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“T-u tucky, t-u ti,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T-u tucky-buzzud eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T-u tucky, t-u ting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T-u tucky-buzzud wing!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Aw, hush, Hitch!” Vinegar Atts bawled, as the
lugubrious, recitative whine of this song greeted their
ears. “Whut you wanter start somepin like dat
fer?”</p>

<p>“I wus jes’ tellin’ you!” Hitch rumbled defensively.</p>

<p>“You niggers know whut?” Pap Curtain exclaimed,
springing to his feet. “I’s gwine to de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Little Moccasin Swamp an’ hide out till dis bad luck
goes by.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” Prince Total proclaimed. “I ain’t
gwine meddle aroun’ de white folks wid dis hoodoo on
me. I’ll shore git serious injury.”</p>

<p>“Us, too,” the other darkies announced promptly.</p>

<p>“Wait till I locks up de Hen-Scratch, niggers!”
Skeeter Butts begged. “I ain’t gwine sell no mo’
booze dis day.”</p>

<p>“Less stay close togedder, niggers,” Vinegar Atts
whined as they started down the dusty road toward
the swamp. “Lemme walk in de exack middle of
you-alls!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The nearest edge of the Little Moccasin Swamp lay
four miles from Tickfall. It was an oblong stretch of
deep, black mud, and deeper and blacker water,
measuring twelve miles the longest way, and six miles
at its widest.</p>

<p>Except for one place, along the Little Moccasin
ridge, it was traversable only by those who knew the
swamp well, and had the instincts of a fox or wolf.</p>

<p>It was full of cypress trees and cypress knees, canebrake,
and rank weeds, pestilential with disease, and
inhabited by countless insects, bugs, worms, snakes,
and animate things of that general nature which
bit or stung or poisoned. It was the last place on
earth which a white man would seek to escape bad
luck.</p>

<p>The sun had set before the six negroes came to
that point where the swamp came right up to the
dusty parish road and ended in a fringe of weedy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
undergrowth. In the midsummer heat this undergrowth
was ten feet high, making a thick curtain
and from the rotting vegetation beneath there came
an almost overpowering smell.</p>

<p>As the six negroes walked down the silent road, the
darkness in the woods, increased by the interlocked
branches of the trees, was intense and overwhelming.
The green fringe of the swamp weeds took on fantastic
shapes, and the negroes, through their disordered
imaginations, beheld claws and wings, and
leering eyes, and sneering mouths, and snarling teeth,
and painted upon the black canvas of the dark
were all the slimy, horrid forms which fear could
conceive.</p>

<p>At last they came to the bridle path which branched
from the parish road and followed the Little Moccasin
ridge to the Dorfoche bayou.</p>

<p>Up to this point in their flight the negroes had traveled
in a bunch, but the narrow path now required
that they go in single file?</p>

<p>“Who is gwine take de lead?” Skeeter Butts asked.</p>

<p>“Not me,” Vinegar Atts bellowed. “My ole maw
tole me dat I wus borned under de sign of de goat,
but I ain’t gwine butt head-fust inter dat swamp.
My dream specify fear, trouble, an’ sorrer. I got a
plenty now!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine lead,” Figger Bush said positively.
“Ef one of dem big swamp jack-rabbits like de one I
dreamed ’bout wus to hop acrost my path, I’d straddle
eve’y tree in dat swamp!”</p>

<p>“I don’t figger on headin’ de peerade,” Pap Curtain
proclaimed. “I got a hunch dat I better take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
good keer of myse’f. My dream specify serious
injury. It don’t take hardly nothin’ to hurt a nigger
ef luck’s agin him.”</p>

<p>“I backs out, too,” Prince Total declared. “Dat
path ain’t wide enough fer no wagin wheel, but I
ain’t sayin’ dat a wheel <i>cain’t</i> run on it!”</p>

<p>“I’s gwine fetch up de rear,” Hitch Diamond
boomed in his deep bass. “Misforchine, great loss,
an’ death is a plenty fer po’ Hitchey to tote along wid
de crowd ’thout gittin’ ahead of de bunch wid his
load.”</p>

<p>“Less build us a fire so we kin see!” Skeeter Butts
squealed. “I’s gittin’ de jig-jams standin’ here in de
dark.”</p>

<p>“Us won’t need dis fire long,” Pap Curtain announced
as he pointed to a yellow haze through the
tree. “De full moon is comin’ up!”</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd fer dat!” Vinegar Atts bellowed.
“Us needs two moons!”</p>

<p>When their fire was lighted, Skeeter Butts sat
down upon the trunk of a fallen tree which lay beside
the road, and said:</p>

<p>“Fellers, dis book is shore handed me a wad of
trouble an’ sorrer. It specify dat I is powerful bad
an’ oughter git reformed befo’ I dies an’ goes to hell;
it argufy dat secret enemies is trailin’ along atter me;
an’ it orate dat chi-mer-i-cal plans is tryin’ to engage
wid me!”</p>

<p>“Whut kind of plans is dem?” Vinegar Atts asked.</p>

<p>“I dunno, Revun,” Skeeter said miserably. “It
’pears to me like a preacher oughter know somepin
’bout dat. Whut does you figger it am?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>“Well, suh,” Vinegar announced, after a period of
deep cogitation, “of co’se I would had to scuffle consid’able
to git de real signify of dat long word ’thout
no book of commontaters to read up on; but mos’
gin’ly speakin’, I argufies dat dem kind of plans is
invenjums of de debbil.”</p>

<p>“How does you know?” Skeeter asked uneasily.</p>

<p>“I argufies dis way,” Vinegar declared, boring
with his right middle finger into the palm of his left
hand to emphasize his remarks: “Ef you is gwine die
an’ go to hell ’thout reformin’ yo’ badness, of co’se
yo’ secret enemies am de debbil an’ his angels, an’
dem plans you spoke ’bout is a kind of infernum
machine like a cuttin’-box. I bet you git bofe yo
behime legs chopped off befo’ to-morrer mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“Lawd,” Skeeter sighed pitiably. “I’s powerful
glad dar’s a full moon to-night. She’ll git up over
dem trees in a little while. I needs mo’ light!”</p>

<p>In the light of the fire, Skeeter brought out his
dream book, and gazed at the red cover design.</p>

<p>“Ain’t dar no good dreams in dat book, Skeeter?”
Figger Bush asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dis book is full of ’em,” Skeeter answered.</p>

<p>“Read us some, Skeeter,” Pap Curtain begged.
“Ef we knows whut dey is, mebbe us kin dream ’em
an’ bust de hoodoo.”</p>

<p>“Here is de fust one I sees,” Skeeter replied as he
began to read laboriously: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>“‘Lion&mdash;To see one denotes
admittunce to de sawciety of dis-tin-guish-ed
pussons. To sit or ride on de back of a lion denotes
de pro-tec-tion of some powerful pussonage. To

dream of eatin’ de flesh of a lion denotes some high
of-fice&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, shuckin’s!” Prince Total exclaimed. “A
nigger never could dream ’bout no lion. Us might
dream ’bout a lizard.”</p>

<p>“You better not, Prince,” Skeeter warned him.
“Listen to dis: ‘Lizard&mdash;Misfortune through false
an’ de-ceit-ful friends.’”</p>

<p>“Fer de Lawd’s sake, Skeeter,” Vinegar howled
impatiently. “Look over dat book an’ see ain’t dar
no way to bust a bad hoodoo dream-sign!”</p>

<p>The pages of the dream book rustled for ten minutes
while the negroes sat in expectant silence. At
last Skeeter squealed:</p>

<p>“I done foun’ a new page, niggers! It’s all ’bout
signs an’ omens. It say dis: ‘How-ever skep-ti-cal
some pussons pro-fess to be on de subjeck of signs
which ad-mon-ish an’ forewarn&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut dat out!” Hitch Diamond growled.
“Us b’lieves in ’em&mdash;read de signs!”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Skeeter began:</p>

<p>“‘Ef yo’ lef’ eye-brow be visited wid a tantalizin’
itchin’, be as-sured dat you are goin’ to look upon a
painful sight&mdash;de corp’ of a valued frien’.”</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond sprang to his feet, while every
negro gazed upon him with fearsome curiosity, at the
same time, unconsciously reaching up and scratching
their left eyebrows!</p>

<p>“Ef you niggers ain’t got no real objections, I’ll git
out from under dis tree,” Hitch said in pitiful tones.
“Dis tree is been here ’bout a millyum years, an’ I
’speck it’s gittin’ ready to fall over.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>“Dat’d shore wuck a bad accidunt on me,” Figger
remarked as he moved to the middle of the road.</p>

<p>“Let Skeeter read some mo’ signs!” Prince Total
howled as he walked out and squatted in the middle
of the road like a frog. “Mebbe us kin find somepin
dat’ll bust Hitch’s luck.”</p>

<p>“‘When you are af-fec-ted by itchin’ on de spine of
yo’ back,’” Skeeter read, “‘be assured dat yo’se’f
or some one near-ly re-lat-ed to you is about to suffer
a violent death!’”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Vinegar Atts bawled.</p>

<p>There was silence for a quarter of an hour, while
fear gripped the hearts of the negroes with iron
fingers and squeezed out all hope, as we crush the
water from a sponge.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts was breathing like the exhaust of a
steam engine.</p>

<p>“Revun Atts,” Skeeter said in a weak, frightened
voice, “I feels powerful bad, an’ I was thinkin’ dat
I’d like to hear a few advices of de Bible preached an’
a little religium singin’.”</p>

<p>“I cain’t he’p you now, Brudder,” Vinegar panted.
“Wait till I git my breath back. How kin I bawl
out wid de message when I’s all wind-broke like
dis?”</p>

<p>Skeeter waited a few minutes, then turned to his
dreadful dream book and began to read, mumbling
to himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly Skeeter raised his head with a jerk and
gazed up at the moon. He sprang to his feet and
began to count on his fingers. The others watched
him with intense curiosity. Finally he howled:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>“He’p me, niggers; he’p me quick! Whut day of
de mont’ is dis?”</p>

<p>“Dis is de twenty-six’!” Vinegar panted. “De
day of de full moon.”</p>

<p>“When did de new moon come in?” Skeeter asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“De new moon wus de tenth!” Pap Curtain
informed him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawdy!” Skeeter howled, his voice breaking
into a sob.</p>

<p>He squatted down and held the book close to the
fire, reading aloud to himself in a low tone.</p>

<p>“How many days is passed since de new moon,
brudders?” Skeeter inquired in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Sixteen!” Vinegar replied, after making the count.</p>

<p>“Us all had our dreams las’ night, didn’t we?”
Skeeter squealed.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” the chorus answered.</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy, niggers, <i>we is saved</i>!” Skeeter
screamed, waving his dream book about his head.
“I done found a new page in dis book!”</p>

<p>“Whut do she say?” the chorus screamed.</p>

<p>“Listen to dis!” Skeeter panted: “‘Jedgments
drawn from de moon’s age: Dreams on de fifteenth
day atter de new moon <i>will not come to pass</i>; whatever
bizzness a pusson undertakes dis day will prosper.
De sixteenth day differs very little from de
pre-ced-in’; but any undertakin’ on dis day will come
to a foolish end.’”</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!” Vinegar Atts bellowed, springing
to his feet. “I’s gwine trust de Lawd an’ mosey
back to Tickfall!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>“Hol’ on, niggers!” Skeeter squealed, as the others
also sprang up.</p>

<p>Skeeter stooped over the fire and laid his little
volume on the interpretation of dreams upon the hot
ashes.</p>

<p>“I wish I had my dollar back,” he sighed, as the
flames leaped up to the added fuel. “Dat shore wus
a dam-fool book.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="The_Gift_of_Power">The Gift of Power</h2>


<p>Vinegar Atts was in trouble.</p>

<p>He sat in the shade of a chinaberry tree in the rear
of the Hen-Scratch saloon, his gorilla-like hands nursing
his fat knees, his fat stomach resting upon his
lap, his moonlike baby face twisted into countless
wrinkles as if he were just tuning up to cry. Tiny
beads of nervous sweat rolled down his face and neck,
and he mopped them off at intervals with an immense
red bandanna handkerchief. He jiggered nervously
with his ponderous feet, kicking up tiny clouds of
sand from the sun-scorched earth. His pipe lay upon
the ground by his chair where it had dropped
unnoticed when he attempted to put it in his pocket.
Skeeter Butts came out of the saloon, carrying his
chair. He placed it beside the fat preacher, lighted
a cigarette and entered with Vinegar into the silent
fellowship of sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p>After a long silence Vinegar said mournfully:</p>

<p>“I cogitate dat they done deeprive me of my goat,
Skeeter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sur; dat’s so, suh. It ’pears to me dat you is
fightin’ it out wid yo’se’f fer de las’ place in de race.”</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts sighed. He picked up his pipe from
the ground, filled it with strong perique tobacco,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
lighted it, then let the bowl drop off of the stem, scattering
the ashes over his lap and spilling the tobacco.
Not noticing the accident, Vinegar sucked vigorously
on the stem, and gave himself up to gloomy meditations.</p>

<p>“I been de pasture of de Shoofly church fer twenty
year hand-runnin’, Skeeter,” Vinegar remarked at
last. “I begged de loose change outen de pockets of
de white folks to build dat church. I wus de fust
preacher an’ de onlies’ preacher dey is ever had dar.
An’ now dey is gwine gib me de farewell go-by.”</p>

<p>“Dat new nigger preacher shore is makin’ a bull-eye
hit wid de members,” Skeeter remarked. “You
see, de members of de Shoofly church is done got
acquainted wid yo’ ways. Dey done listened to
dem same sermonts fer de las’ twenty year&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dey listen but dey don’t heed,” Vinegar Atts
interrupted disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Shorely. Dat’s de way mos’ church members
is,” Skeeter replied. “But, you see, dis new preacher
he comes in wid a new loud voice&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You gimme a good dram an’ two sour lemons an’
I kin beller louder dan any yuther preacher in de
worl’,” Vinegar Atts declared.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter replied propitiatingly. “But
dese Tickfall niggers is done got intimate wid yo’
bawl an’ it don’t sot heavy on deir minds no more.
Dey figger dat dey needs a change of tone.”</p>

<p>“Dey shore is treated me jes’ like a feetball,”
Vinegar mourned. “Kicked me aroun’ scandalous!”</p>

<p>“Is de cormittee fired you yit?” Skeeter asked
sympathetically.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>“Naw!” Vinegar exploded. “Ef dey fires me, I’ll
punch de stuffin’ outen deir hides. But I ’spose dey
is gittin’ ready to send me my resign.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s powerful bad,” Skeeter sighed. “I stuck
to you like a frien’ because you is always been one of
my bes’ silent customers. I talked for you awful
hard, an’ holped you all I could. I’s sorry dat dey
drapped you down.”</p>

<p>“Dat new preacher worked a buzzo on me,” Vinegar
lamented. “He fotch up in dis town while I wus
oozin’ along in de Shongaloo woods, an’ had all de
cormittee pregaged befo’ I got back. Fust news I
knowed he had done hogged all de hominy. He
hadn’t oughter did me dat way.”</p>

<p>“He shore did ack familious wid anodder man’s
job,” Skeeter agreed. “But whut made de mostes’
hit wus his looks: he’s got a new suit of clothes, an’
gold eye-specks, an’ a ruben ring. He waves a silk
handkercher, totes a teethbrush an’ wears pink
socks.”</p>

<p>“All dem things is jes’ like de curl in a pig’s tail,”
Vinegar Atts proclaimed. “Dey is ornamental, but
dey don’t make no more pig!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s a fack,” Skeeter grinned. “But a pig
whut ain’t got no ornamint twist in his tail a-tall is
suttinly pure scrub!”</p>

<p>Vinegar stooped and recovered the bowl of his pipe,
refilled it and began to smoke furiously. Skeeter
fiddled with a brass wrist-watch which he wore
with prideful ostentation. A hound dog lying upon
the saloon steps scratched himself with such a noisy
and monotonous knocking of his elbow against the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
boards that Vinegar roused himself and hurled
maledictions and pine knots at him.</p>

<p>Then Skeeter asked:</p>

<p>“When is de cormittee gwine hold its las’ meetin’?”</p>

<p>“To-morrer night in my orfice in de Shoofly
church,” Vinegar told him. “I figger dat’ll be de las’
time I’ll ever set by dat table. Of co’se, de cormittee
will vote agin me an’ de church will vote wid de cormittee.”</p>

<p>“Whut is you gwine do fer a livin’?” Skeeter
asked with interest.</p>

<p>“I done got me a job as Marse Tom Gaitskill’s
butler,” Vinegar said. “Hitch Diamond, he used to
buttle fer Marse Tom, but de kunnel specify dat
Hitch couldn’t show no hon’able scars whar he hurt
hisself wuckin’, so he fired him. I got Hitch’s job.”</p>

<p>“Dat wus good luck fer you,” Skeeter said in a
delighted tone.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, ’twas bad luck,” Vinegar said mournfully.
“You see, Hitch is a member of dat church
cormittee, an’ he’s gwine vote agin me because I
picked up de job whut he drapped.”</p>

<p>“Lawd,” Skeeter sighed. “You is like a snake
whut’s got his tail in his mouf&mdash;jes’ spinnin’ aroun’
yo’se’f in a circuous ring!”</p>

<p>Vinegar picked up his hat and stood up.</p>

<p>“I got to mosey up to Marse Tom’s, Skeeter,” he
said. “De kunnel is gwine hab big comp’ny tonight.
I’s much obleeged fer yo’ pity in my many
troubles.”</p>

<p>“Pick up a brave heart, Vinegar,” Skeeter said encouragingly.
“Mebbe de good Lawd will pervide.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>

<p>“I ain’t so certain ’bout dat, Skeeter,” Vinegar
replied gloomily, as he walked out of the yard. “It
looks to me mighty like Proverdunce is done busted a
dynamite cap under my shirt!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four men sat around the table in the Gaitskill
dining-room. The covers had been removed, and
they were devoting themselves to an evening of
boyish frolic. Everything went.</p>

<p>There was Colonel Tom Gaitskill, an ideal host,
courtly, genial, whose fountains of humor never went
dry, making him eternally young. Near him sat
the Reverend Dr. Sentelle, eloquent, scholarly,
whose fine face, seamed and wrinkled with suffering,
was written all over with the literature of experience.
Across the table was John Flournoy, the sheriff
whose reputation exceeded the boundaries of the
State, a man with a giant’s form and strength, a
woman’s tenderness, and the courage of a host of
jungle beasts.</p>

<p>And the guest of honor for the evening was Gaitskill’s
life-long friend, Captain Lemuel Manse, a
retired millionaire, who had received his title from
the fact that he was owner of that beautiful sea-going
yacht, whose keel had cut the waters of every sea
upon the globe, and which had brought to Tickfall
the never-to-be-forgotten Diada.</p>

<p>For four hours Vinegar Atts had served them in
that dining-room, silent, watchful, with some mysterious
instinct foreseeing the minutest need of every
guest and meeting it before the guest himself was
conscious what his need was.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>The talk had become reminiscent.</p>

<p>“Say, Lem,” Colonel Gaitskill remarked, “do you
remember how we used to scare the everlasting gizzards
out of the niggers on the plantation by holding
spiritualistic séances in their cabins?”</p>

<p>“Will I ever forget it?” Captain Manse laughed.
“The darkies used to run when they saw me coming!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if you have forgotten how to make the
table dance?” Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p>Captain Manse promptly pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts had no idea what was going to happen,
but he knew instinctively that the table should
be cleared. His long arms reached over the shoulders
of the men and the liquors and the cigars were placed
upon the sideboard.</p>

<p>With fun sparkling in his magnetic eyes, Manse
arose and began the repetition of a stunt which had
amused him half a century before.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he began, in a sing-song voice,
imitating the manner of the professional mediums,
“there is an even number of us present, which makes
a perfect spiritualistic ring. I presume you will
smile and chuckle and fling unholy jests at the wonderful
miracles which I perform, but I shall most
certainly convince you of my close communion with
the spirits of the unseen world. You might doubt
a professional test, but this is an amateur séance.
Here is no hidden machinery. Here are no paid confederates.
You are my best friends, and why should
I try to fool you? We are all sincere and open to
conviction, and any results which are obtained must
surely be authentic.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<p>This address concluded amid laughter and applause.</p>

<p>The four men drew up to the heavy mahogany
table and placed their hands upon its polished top,
palms down.</p>

<p>“My friends,” Captain Manse said in a husky
whisper, “you will all keep silent, please. You will
notice that it looks impossible for any person to
move this heavy table by merely placing the hands
upon it. No strength can be put into the open palms,
it is impracticable to pull or lift or push from the
elbows. The legs or feet cannot be brought into use,
for they are not allowed to touch the board. And
yet the table will move! Silence, gentlemen! If a
spirit is present, he will give us a message through the
table!”</p>

<p>Several long minutes slowly passed. No sound was
audible except the steady, deep breathing of the four
men sitting at the table.</p>

<p>As for Vinegar Atts, respiration had ceased some
minutes before.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after the long strain of tense silence,
Dr. Sentelle, the semi-invalid, took a deep breath&mdash;a
sigh&mdash;and the heavy table rose slowly, teeteringly,
under his delicate, fragile, blue-veined hands!</p>

<p>“Ah, some spirit has come at last,” Captain Manse
exclaimed in a deep, sepulchral, sing-song undertone.</p>

<p>Again there was total silence, and the strain of
waiting, and the sweating palms of the men outspread
upon the table; Sheriff Flournoy took a long, deep
breath.</p>

<p>Again the table tipped, bumped against the floor,
and settled down!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>“Dr. Sentelle,” Captain Manse spoke in a tone
hushed and full of awe, “the spirit of my long-lost
dead poll-parrot will answer any question which you
desire to ask!”</p>

<p>Dr. Sentelle sighed audibly.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes toward the ceiling and in a low,
thrilling, beautiful voice, he asked:</p>

<p>“Are you happy, Polly-parrot, since you became
a bird of paradise?”</p>

<p>Instantly, the heavy table struck the floor three
times&mdash;bump! bump! bump! “Y-e-s.”</p>

<p>There was a whoop of laughter and the men sprang
to their feet.</p>

<p>“By George!” Gaitskill exclaimed with a chuckle.
“If some of the experiences Lem and I had when we
were young were wiped out of my memory, I wouldn’t
know my soul in eternity.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Captain Manse laughed. “I
recall one Christmas day when Tom’s niggers were
eating in the kitchen, Tom and I went in there and
made that table dance all over the place and scared
the darkies so they wouldn’t touch a bite of that
Christmas dinner. Of course, we had to fake that
stunt. In fact, most of this spiritualistic stuff is
faked now.”</p>

<p>“How is it done?” Flournoy asked.</p>

<p>Captain Manse explained several of the methods
by which the table-tipping fakes deceived the credulous
public, then the talk drifted into national politics.</p>

<p>In a moment Gaitskill looked up with surprise.
Did not Vinegar Atts know that the theme of politics
called for liquors and cigars?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>Vinegar Atts stood beside the door as motionless as
a Chinese idol, and his black face, expressive of meditation,
mystification, fright and awe, made him
almost as ugly as an idol.</p>

<p>But the colonel’s look galvanized him into action,
and he was once more the silent, well-oiled, efficient
machine of service.</p>

<p>“Let’s move out on the gallery, gentlemen,”
Gaitskill suggested after a while. “We’ll find it
cooler there.”</p>

<p>As the men passed out, Gaitskill lingered a moment
and said:</p>

<p>“That’s all, Vinegar. You are dismissed for the
evening.”</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts pulled the doors of the dining-room
together, waited a moment until he was sure the men
had settled themselves upon the gallery, and then
he did a very unusual thing.</p>

<p>Seating himself at the mahogany table in the chair
which Captain Manse had occupied, he spread his
immense black hands palm-downward upon its shiny
surface and with a perfect imitation of Manse’s
manner, sat there for five minutes, in ludicrous,
pop-eyed expectation, waiting for something to
happen!</p>

<p>He looked up at the ceiling, and down to the table.
He pushed on the table-top with all his strength.
He drew in a breath which seemed to consume all the
air in the room, and emitted a sigh like the exhaust
of a blast furnace&mdash;but all to no avail.</p>

<p>“It cain’t be did widout plenty practice,” he
assured himself. “But I ain’t got nothin’ to do all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
de rest of dis night but kotch on how to make her
jigger!”</p>

<p>He went out to his cabin in the rear of the Gaitskill
yard and sat down beside a cheap pine table.</p>

<p>When morning dawned he was still sitting there,
puffing and blowing, his sweating palms pressed
downward upon the table’s rough surface, his credulity
unshaken despite his failure, waiting for something
to happen!</p>

<p>“Lawd,” he sighed. “She ain’t even wagged her
tail fer me all night long!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Vinegar Atts spent the day in various activities,
some of them of a personal nature, and some under
the direction of Colonel Gaitskill.</p>

<p>When evening came he was free, and started on a
gloomy walk to the office of the Shoofly church,
where the Committee on Pulpit Supply was to hold
its last session and determine whether Vinegar should
retain the pulpit which he had occupied for twenty
years, or surrender his prophet’s mantle to another.</p>

<p>Sitting around a cheap pine table in the middle of
the room, Vinegar found Pap Curtain, Hitch Diamond,
Figger Bush and Skeeter Butts. Of the four,
Skeeter was now his only friend.</p>

<p>At the end of the table sat the Reverend Tucky
Chew Sipe, a tall, black, thin-faced, ladder-headed
negro, whose clothes were so loud that they proclaimed
the man a block and a half away. He bore
himself with an air of triumph, and gazed upon Vinegar
Atts with a look of mingled pity and contempt.</p>

<p>Vinegar was also dressed in the loudest manner his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
purse would afford, but the showiest things about him
were his extraordinarily large and immaculately
white shirt cuffs. His manner was meek and apologetic,
utterly unnatural to Vinegar, who had been
accustomed for twenty years to butt and bellow like
a bull of Bashan among the sheep in the Shoofly
fold.</p>

<p>“De meetin’ will come to orders an’ de sec’tary will
specify de bizzness of de las’ session,” Pap Curtain,
the chairman, announced importantly.</p>

<p>“Us didn’t do nothin’ but gass,” Figger Bush
answered promptly. “De Revun Vinegar Atts had
done made hisse’f abasent, an’ us didn’t take no
action on de Revun Tucky Sipe gittin’ de job. Us
took a mebbe-so vote, an’ all of us favored Tucky
Sipe, excusin’ Skeeter Butts.”</p>

<p>Figger sat down, and Vinegar Atts moved his
chair to the table and seated himself close beside the
secretary.</p>

<p>“De bizzness of dis meetin’ am to choose a
preacher fer de Shoofly church,” Pap Curtain announced.
“Ef anybody is got any speeches on deir
mind, let ’em squall out!”</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond arose and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“Brudders, I feels dat us needs a change. We is
done had a fat, squat-leg preacher fer twenty year,
an’ now dis here spindlin’-shank is come applyin’
fer de job, an’ I favors him. He knows how to
wear clothes, he’s got a good-soundin’ whoop to his
religium advices, an’ knows how to tag on de ’rousements
when he ’postolizes.”</p>

<p>“I feels de same motion, brudders,” Figger Bush
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
put in when Hitch had taken his seat. “Vinegar
gibs us good advices, but it ’pears like he cain’t make
us take ’em. I heerd de Revun Tucky Sipe las’
Sunday, an’ he gib us cautions jes’ like he had done
had a session wid de gram-jury. I ain’t much mo’
dan a seat-member of dis church, but I likes de skinny
parsons best.”</p>

<p>“I got de same notions in my head, too, brudders,”
Pap Curtain declared, as Figger sat down.
“I is shore dat Tucky Sipe won’t slanderize nobody,
an’ won’t snoop aroun’ huntin’ fer somebody’s sins
to preach again an’ git often de subjeck dat way. He
jes’ preaches de true word. I votes hearty fer Tucky
Sipe!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silent expectation, and all
eyes were turned toward Skeeter Butts. Skeeter
wiggled and clawed at his head, but did not offer to
speak. At last, Vinegar Atts said in a husky voice:</p>

<p>“Skeeter, will you please git me a drink of water
outen de well. I feels powerful dry in my innards.
Dar’s a pint tin cup out dar by de water-buckit.”</p>

<p>There was another silence until Skeeter returned
with the cup. Vinegar drained the contents at one
gulp, then turned the cup upside down and set it in
the middle of the table.</p>

<p>“Would you wish to relieve yo’ mind, Skeeter?”
Pap Curtain asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Skeeter said in an embarrassed tone.
“You’all knows dat I favors de Revun Vinegar Atts.
Him an’ me is good frien’s, an’ he ain’t never did me
no harm. I favors keepin’ him wid us, but of co’se,
I gotter bow down when de vote stan’s three to one.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<p>During Skeeter’s speech, Vinegar Atts sat beside
the table, his hands spread out, palms downward,
upon the top.</p>

<p>Suddenly the table began to move! It slid slowly
forward, then slipped backward, then tipped up on
one end!</p>

<p>“Stop shoving dis table aroun’!” Pap Curtain
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts moved his chair back so that all could
see his feet and his knees. Then the table slowly
lifted a few inches, and fell with a sliding motion,
hitting Pap Curtain a jolt in the stomach, and almost
upsetting the smoky oil lamp which occupied the
center of the table.</p>

<p>“Hey, dar!” the Reverend Tucky Sipe exclaimed,
as he grabbed at the tottering lamp. “Whut ails
dat table to make it cut up dat way?”</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts emitted a deep, audible sigh, and his
eyes were fixed upon the ceiling in a look of abstracted
reverence and devotion.</p>

<p>An awed silence fell upon the men, and Skeeter
Butts ostentatiously moved his chair close to the
open door. If anything happened, Skeeter intended
to lead the getaway.</p>

<p>The heat of the night was intense and overwhelming.
Above their heads countless mosquitoes, attracted
by the light, circled ceaselessly with an
annoying whine of wings. Far away came the
rumble of a summer thunderstorm. From a pine
tree in the graveyard the voice of a screech-owl
quavered like the cry of a child lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Reverend Tucky Chew Sipe promptly arose and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
turned the side pockets of his pantaloons wrong side
out&mdash;a sure cure for screech-owls!</p>

<p>The men moved back from the table and stared
at it with popping eyeballs. Vinegar sat beside it
alone, his palms outspread upon its rough surface.</p>

<p>A loud sigh came from Vinegar’s throat.</p>

<p>The table slowly rose, teetered for a breathless
moment, then fell to the floor with a loud bump.
The lamp chimney tottered and fell upon the table,
smashing into tiny fragments.</p>

<p>The negroes sprang to their feet in terror&mdash;all
except Vinegar Atts. He remained with his hands
upon the table, sitting as if in a trance.</p>

<p>The lamp wick flared, filling the room with smoke.
After a moment Vinegar adjusted the wick, setting
the lamp in the center of the table, moving the pint
cup to one side as he did so.</p>

<p>Then he moved his chair back from the table and
seated himself beside Skeeter Butts at the door.</p>

<p>For a short time no word was spoken. Then the
men began to recover their nerve, and Pap Curtain
resumed the discussion of their business:</p>

<p>“I figger dat enough has done been said, brudders,”
he declared. “De lamp chimney is done
busted an’ us ain’t gwine hab no light on dis subjeck
very much longer. I motions dat&mdash;My Gawd, <i>whut
is dat</i>?”</p>

<p>This last question was a scream, as Pap pointed
with trembling fingers at the pint tin cup. It was
moving slowly across the table!</p>

<p>The men watched its erratic movements with
breathless fascination. It moved forward toward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
the edge, then backward toward the center of the
table; then it moved slowly in a circle, and finally
took a straight line and toppled off the edge of the
table onto the floor!</p>

<p>Every negro jumped about two feet into the air,
and bolted into the yard with a loud whoop.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts alone retained his seat by the door
and seemed to be unconscious of what was happening.
They looked at him in wonder, not speaking a word.</p>

<p>After a while Vinegar stood up, opened the door
which entered into the church auditorium, and
returned with a new lamp chimney. Wiping it out
carefully with a soiled bandanna handkerchief, he
adjusted it upon the lamp, and said in a cordial
voice:</p>

<p>“Come in, brudders! Us is done had excitements,
but dis meetin’ ain’t bust up yit!”</p>

<p>The darkies timidly re-entered the room and sat
down on the edge of their chairs ready for flight
upon the least provocation.</p>

<p>After giving them time to recover their composure,
Vinegar said:</p>

<p>“Brudder Chairman, I figger dat it would be doin’
de high perlite ef you axed fer a speech from de
preacher whut is done served dis communion to de
best of his ability fer twenty year.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Elder!” Pap Curtain said heartily.
“Us ’ll shore be glad to hear yo’ cormitmints!”</p>

<p>Vinegar hesitated a moment, then spoke impressively:</p>

<p>“Brudders, I believes dat a preacher oughter hab
some things besides good clothes, spindlin’ shanks, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
’rousement voice an’ a appertite fer good grub. Does
you’all believe dat?”</p>

<p>No one answered the question, but after a pause
Pap Curtain inquired:</p>

<p>“Whut else do he oughter hab?”</p>

<p>“He oughter hab de gift of power!” Vinegar roared
in a mighty voice. “Does you’all believe dat?”</p>

<p>“Sho’ly!” the men murmured.</p>

<p>“Now, brudders,” Vinegar went on, “I built dis
here church wid my own hands; I begged de money
from de white folks to buy de timber whut went in it;
I sawed de wood whut made de pulpit an’ de benches,
an’ eve’y block of wood in dis church knows my hands
an’ obeys my voice. I got de gift of power!”</p>

<p>He paused. The men looked at the pine table
with shifty, frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“When I puts my wide open hand on a piece of
furniture in dis church, it gits up an’ rambles!”
Vinegar bellowed. “De spirits of de onseen worl’
tells dem furniture to git up an’ hustle! Kin de
Revun Tucky Chew Sipe say de same as me?”</p>

<p>Tucky Sipe stared at Atts with the expression of a
glass-eyed doll; he fingered a mangy rabbit foot in his
left hip pocket; he licked his parched lips with a dry
tongue; but he offered no reply.</p>

<p>“When I puts my hands down on dis table, I got de
gift of power to make her move!” Vinegar bawled.
“Even de tin cups goes ramblin’ aroun’ when dey
hears my hawn!”</p>

<p>He glared around him, his hands clenched, his
powerful neck bent, his head lowered as if about to
butt&mdash;giving a ludicrous imitation of an angry bull
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
getting ready to make a charge. He walked over to
where Tucky Chew Sipe was sitting, and shook an
impressive finger before that gentleman’s long nose:</p>

<p>“I gib you fair warnin’ right now, Tucky Chew
Sipe, dat de very fust sermont whut you preaches in
dis church will be yo’ last&mdash;I’ll walk up to de side of
dis church and put my hands agin de outside wall,
an’ move dis whole house plum over to de State of
Arkansas!”</p>

<p>Vinegar turned, shut the door of exit from the
building, locked it and put the key in his pocket.
Then he sat down beside the table and spread his
hands palm-downward on the top.</p>

<p>He seemed to sink into a trance, his eyes rolled
back, his alligator mouth came open, his breath came
and went with a loud wheeze, and at intervals a low
moan issued from his throat.</p>

<p>The minutes passed. The men watched Vinegar
with ever-increasing horror. Tucky Chew Sipe stood
up and flattened himself against the wall, his knees
shaking until they threatened any moment to collapse
and let him down in a heap upon the floor.</p>

<p>Vinegar moaned. A long, deep sigh whistled
through the tense silence, and the table rose two feet
from the floor, teetering uncertainly. Vinegar rose
to his feet, and followed the table in its peregrinations
around the room, his hands spread wide and resting
upon the top.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Tucky Sipe exclaimed.</p>

<p>Instantly the table went high into the air and shot
out toward Tucky Sipe, crashing against the wall,
striking Tucky a mighty blow in his lean and hungry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
stomach, extinguishing the lamp and hurling it to the
floor where it broke into a thousand pieces!</p>

<p>Instantly Vinegar Atts struck a match and held
it up to illumine the darkness.</p>

<p>He glared a moment at the horrified negroes, then
walked over to where the Reverend Tucky Chew
Sipe lay flat on the floor in a hysteria of fear, whooping
like a siren in a fog.</p>

<p>“Shut up, brudder, shut up!” Vinegar howled.
“You done mourned a plenty. Trust de Lawd!”</p>

<p>The match went out and Vinegar struck another.</p>

<p>“Now, honey,” Vinegar said to the frightened
Sipe, “ef you wants dis church, you kin hab it&mdash;but
my advices to you is to hunt somewhar fer to git,
an’ trabbel out to’des dat place right now!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Tucky Chew Sipe said in a voice which
strangled in his throat. “I takes yo’ advices. I’s like
dat ole Bill Shazzer in de Bible&mdash;I done observe de
handwrite on de wall!”</p>

<p>The burning match scorched Vinegar’s fingers
and he tossed it aside, sucking the blister as he
unlocked and opened the door. Then he spoke in the
darkness:</p>

<p>“De log-train passes through Tickfall in about ten
minutes, brudder. Skeeter Butts will go to de
deppo wid you an’ speed you on yo’ way. You won’t
make me mad ef you never comes back!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One hour later Vinegar Atts and Skeeter Butts
met in the rear room of the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>“De revun made his git-off, Elder,” Skeeter
grinned. “He specify dat he reternally regretted dat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
he wouldn’t git no more free vittles from de dearly
beloved sisteren, but he ’peared powerful anxious to
trabel jes’ de same.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckin ef dar ain’t no likely cand’date fer
my preachin’ job, de cormittee will let me hold on to
it, won’t dey?” Vinegar asked.</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Skeeter grinned. “Dey say you is
done bewitched dat church an’ dey is gwine let you
keep it till you die.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de bes’ news I’s heerd sence de las’ pay
day,” Vinegar exulted. “I shore do like to bawl de
message in dat communion. It he’ps me git a lot of
wind offen my breast.”</p>

<p>Vinegar took out a soiled handkerchief and mopped
the copious sweat from his beaming face.</p>

<p>“Lawd,” he sighed in delighted tones. “Ain’t
it hot!”</p>

<p>“Lay off dat long-tail prancin’-albert coat, Revun,”
Skeeter said irritably. “You oughter run yo’se’f
through a wringer befo’ you wear dem clothes&mdash;dey
makes you too moistuous&mdash;you’s spoutin’ water like
a whale right now!”</p>

<p>Vinegar sprang up gladly and pulled off his
coat.</p>

<p>Then he glanced at his wrists in shocked surprise,
and began to put on his coat again with all possible
haste.</p>

<p>But sharp-eyed Skeeter Butts was too quick for
him. He sprang up, seized the coat, and wrenched
it away.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on, Vinegar!” he barked. “Whut you doin’
wid all dat harness on yo’ wrists?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>Vinegar pulled back his big white cuffs and sheepishly
displayed the “harness.”</p>

<p>Around each wrist a large leather strap was securely
bound, and from each strap, projecting toward Vinegar’s
fingers was a powerful iron hook with a sharp
point!</p>

<p>“Whut in de name of mud is dat fer?” Skeeter
howled.</p>

<p>Vinegar grinned, sat down at a little pine table in
the middle of the room, spread his open hands upon
the table, palms downward, just as he had done at the
Shoofly church.</p>

<p>The two iron hooks fitted securely under the edge
of the table, and were effectually concealed by his
white cuffs. With the grip and the leverage thus
secured, the gorilla arms and iron wrists of Vinegar
Atts could have lifted a bale of cotton.</p>

<p>Vinegar quietly picked up the little table and
grinning like a big fat monkey, pranced all around
the room before the astounded, admiring eyes of
Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>Skeeter sat down and chuckled with delight.</p>

<p>“Vinegar,” he said, “I always figgered dat a
preacher wus a nachel-bawn fool or he wouldn’t be a
preacher. But atter dis I is gwine hand a tin prize
to you fer brains!”</p>

<p>Vinegar could see no particular advantage in
confessing that Colonel Tom Gaitskill and Captain
Lemuel Manse had spent the entire morning of that
day manufacturing Vinegar’s harness, and rehearsing
him in the sensational stunt which he had pulled off
at the Shoofly church.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>“You won’t make no great big mistake ef you gib
me two tin prizes fer brains,” Vinegar remarked
complacently.</p>

<p>Skeeter clawed at his close-cropped head a moment,
then asked another question:</p>

<p>“Elder, how did you make dat tin cup prance all
over de top of dat table?”</p>

<p>Vinegar’s mouth was filled with chewing tobacco
and his soul with peace. He ruminated a minute,
grinning at the little barkeeper. When Skeeter
began to show signs of impatience, Vinegar answered:</p>

<p>“I put a tree-frog under dat cup,” he said.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>Sugar Sibley, the dusky belle of the Tickfall Parish
Fair, sat in the Jim Crow section of the grand
stand, clothed in all the colors of the rainbow, posing
with all the indolence and insolence of an African
princess, lavishing her charms upon the yellow-faced
barkeeper of the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>“Whut hoss we gwine bet on next, Skeeter?” she
inquired.</p>

<p>“Dunno,” Skeeter answered anxiously. “I hopes
it’ll be a winner.”</p>

<p>Skeeter removed his hat and rubbed a nervous
hand over a closely cropped head, down the middle
of which a part had been made with a razor.</p>

<p>His face was seamed with fine lines of worry, and
the nervous sweat pouring down his face had wilted
his high, white collar to a soiled and crumpled rag.</p>

<p>“I don’t like a nigger whut parts his wool in de
middle,” Sugar announced, eyeing Skeeter’s head,
with disapproving looks. “Ef a hoss eats in my
trough, his mane is all got to lay on one side.”</p>

<p>Skeeter hastily put on his hat.</p>

<p>The band struck up the lively tune of <i>Rastus, Why
Don’t You Pay de Rent</i>?</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Sugar exclaimed. “One dem hosses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
in dat nex’ race is named Rastus. You go bet ten
dollars on Rastus, Skeeter! An’ fotch me back some
loose change. You ain’t winned me nothin’ dis
whole day.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got but ten bucks lef’ over,” Skeeter confessed.
“Ef Rastus don’t win, I’s shore a busted
cornstitution!”</p>

<p>“Whut’s dat?” Sugar demanded sharply. “You
mean to signify dat you ain’t fotch but one hundred
dollars out here wid you to entertain a cullud lady?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Skeeter declared, “an’ I done loss it
all but dis here tenner.”</p>

<p>“You’s gwine lose a lady frien’, nigger,” Sugar
remarked in a disgusted tone. “Nothin’ don’t talk
aroun’ me but dollars.”</p>

<p>“My talkin’ dollars is done expe’unce a vocal
breakdown,” Skeeter answered shamefacedly.</p>

<p>A tall, yellow negro with a furtive manner, a baboon
face, eyes too close together, and lips which
carried an habitual sneer, passed them, walked down
to the rail, and stopped to gaze up and down the track.</p>

<p>“Does you know dat man?” Sugar Sibley asked.</p>

<p>“Dat’s Pap Curtain,” Skeeter informed her.
“He’s de meanes’ slick-head nigger in Tickfall.”</p>

<p>Then Skeeter left her, walked down to Pap, and
said:</p>

<p>“Pap, is you got any money?”</p>

<p>“Shore!” Pap informed him, patting four capacious
pockets bulging with silver coins.</p>

<p>“Cain’t you loant me a few loose change?” Skeeter
pleaded.</p>

<p>“Naw, son,” Pap replied positively. “Whenever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
I loants money to a frien’ I axes dat money an’ dat
frien’ good-by. I ain’t never gwine see ary one no
mo’.”</p>

<p>“I sho’ am on de list fer he’p,” Skeeter mourned.
“I’s armin’ a she-queen aroun’ an’ she done et up all
my money an’ bawlin’ fer mo’ an’ I’s skeart she’ll
pass me down because I’s busted.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s too bad,” Pap sympathized. “You had
oughter picked de winners.”</p>

<p>“Is you winned all dat money wid bets?” Skeeter
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh!” Pap made emphatic answer. “I
don’t bet on nothin’. I sells tips! I charges one half
dollar fer eve’y tip per each.”</p>

<p>Skeeter produced his last bill and handed it to Pap.</p>

<p>“Give me nine dollars and fifty cents change.
Pap,” he said eagerly, “an’ a tip on de winner of de
nex’ race.”</p>

<p>Pap handed back the change, caught Skeeter by
the arm, led him to one side out of ear-shot of all
other negroes, and whispered impressively:</p>

<p>“Swa’r befo’ Gawd dat you won’t tell nobody
whar you got dis tip!”</p>

<p>“I prommus!” Skeeter murmured.</p>

<p>Pap bent down, cupped both hands around
Skeeter’s ear like a trumpet, and whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Rastus!”</p>

<p>Skeeter’s little legs bounced him down the steps
of the grand stand and for the next ten minutes he
circulated assiduously among the negroes placing
his private bets.</p>

<p>When Skeeter had gone Pap Curtain turned his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
back to the track and gazed upward in worshipful
adoration of Sugar Sibley as if she were the saint of
his deepest devotion. The gaudy princess opened
wide her large eyes, then squinted them, then slowly
closed one eye and smiled.</p>

<p>Pap promptly pranced up the steps and seated
himself in the place vacated by Skeeter Butts. He
did not act like a stranger, nor as if he regarded an
introduction necessary.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Sugar?” he remarked. “I argufies dat
yo’ name fits you’ corporosity like a candy jaw-breaker
fits a pickaninny’s mouf.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t entirely wrong, Popper,” the lady
grinned. “I’s shore a sweet cake to de coon whut’s
got de dough to mix wid de sugar.”</p>

<p>“Skeeter Butts jes’ now specify to me dat he’s
nearly out of mixin’s,” Pap muttered, fumbling at his
own silver-laden pockets.</p>

<p>“All right, Popper,” Sugar announced complacently.
“Me an’ you will let dat Mr. Muskeeter
fly up de creek.”</p>

<p>“Ef he won’t fly away us’ll screen him off,” Pap
snickered.</p>

<p>Their conversation was brought to an abrupt close
by a loud whoop from the spectators. Five horses
were loping around the track&mdash;loping leisurely in
spite of the fact that their frenzied jockeys were using
whip and spur at every jump. But the racing game
was new to these humble plough-horses, and their
idea seemed to be that if they reached the wire before
the sun set the day’s work would be done.</p>

<p>But the jockey on Rastus found a tender place on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
his mount’s tick-bitten flank and managed to provoke
a spurt of speed which put Rastus two lengths ahead
and kept him there. Rastus won!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Flushed with his triumph and rattling his money,
Skeeter Butts came to where Pap and Sugar were
seated, tossed five dollars in Sugar’s lap, and glared
at Curtain.</p>

<p>“Git outen my seat, Pap!” he commanded.
“You’s tryin’ to deeprive me of my gal!”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Pap answered promptly. “I ain’t
intend no depravity. Besides, I gotter go. ’Bout
fawty niggers wants to cornverse me ’bout dis nex’
race.”</p>

<p>“Whut hoss we gwine bet on nex’, Skeeter?”
Sugar Sibley asked when Pap had gone.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Butts replied, promptly regretting
that he had not been more gracious to Pap Curtain.
“Which way did Pap went?”</p>

<p>“Whut you want wid dat ole man?” Sugar asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Pap is sellin’ tips,” Skeeter explained. “He
teched me off ’bout Rastus winnin’ dat las’ race atter
he made me prommus I wouldn’t tell nobody.”</p>

<p>“I don’t b’lieve it,” Sugar snorted. “I picked
Rastus myself when de band was playin’ dat tune.
How do Popper Curtain know whut hoss is gwine
win?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Skeeter answered. “He’s a slick-head
nigger an’ mebbe he’s got a conjure.”</p>

<p>“Ef Popper knowed whut hoss wus gwine win, he
wouldn’t sell no tips,” Sugar sniffed. “He’d bet!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>“Mebbe dat’s so!” Skeeter agreed, his confidence
shaken by this argument. “But ef you’s so good at
pickin’ de winner, s’pose you name de nex’ one?”</p>

<p>Sugar glanced at a large blackboard under the
starter’s stand where a red-headed boy was chalking
the names of three more horses.</p>

<p>“<i>Doodle-Bug!</i>” she exclaimed eagerly. “Bet on
Doodle, Skeeter!”</p>

<p>Butts walked away, but before he placed a single
bet he trailed Pap Curtain until he found him, placed
a half-dollar in Pap’s willing palm, and demanded the
name of the winner.</p>

<p>Again Pap cupped his hands around Skeeter’s ears
and whispered:</p>

<p>“Doodle-Bug!”</p>

<p>Skeeter took a big breath. Then he got busy.
First he found his friend, Figger Bush.</p>

<p>“Figger,” he panted, “loant me ten dollars. Ef
I never pays it back yo’ credick is good at de Hen-Scratch
till you drinks dat much liquor up.”</p>

<p>Figger counted out the money, and Skeeter raced
around until he had borrowed a similar sum from
Hitch Diamond, Prince Total, an Mustard Prophet,
thus increasing his supply of money until he had
fifty-five dollars. Then he raced around some more,
betting every dollar on Doodle-Bug.</p>

<p>Walking back to the grand stand, he found Pap
Curtain engaged in a lively conversation with Sugar
Sibley. Jealousy boiled in Skeeter’s heart and his
saddle-colored face flushed to a brownish crimson.
He strode to where they were sitting and began:</p>

<p>“Looky here, Pap, you let my nigger gal alone. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
don’t want no ole gray-wool baboon monkeyin’ aroun’
whar I cotes a lady. You hike outen dis!”</p>

<p>“Set down, son, and watch de race!” Pap responded
in a patronizing tone. “A nigger hadn’t
oughter git uppity when he bets his las’ dollar on
Doodle-Bug. Doodle might run in de groun’.”</p>

<p>At that moment Doodle galloped onto the track,
and Skeeter postponed his quarrel to watch the horse
which carried his money.</p>

<p>Doodle-Bug was a white-faced Tuckapoo mustang;
and the Tuckapoo mustang is the beast which the
Louisiana Indians purposely left behind when they
were forced to migrate to Indian Territory, to wreak
vengeance upon the paleface for depriving them of
their patrimonial landholdings. Besides being able
to buck, bite, and kick like other horses, the Tuckapoo
mustang can butt like a goat, break a man’s jaw
by switching his tail, and has the deer’s trick of jumping
high in the air and coming down on top of a man,
spearing him to the ground with his four stiff legs.
He has more ways of ridding himself of his rider
than a trick circus mule, and, unlike the circus mule,
he is not good-natured about it.</p>

<p>Doodle-Bug balked in front of the grand stand,
and seven men tried to induce him to go. Four got
kicked, one got bit, the jockey was bucked off, and
finally Doodle-Bug laid down on his back, squealing
like a pig, his four legs fanning the air like the legs of
an overturned beetle.</p>

<p>The men backed away from those rapid-firing legs
and waited until it pleased Doodle-Bug to get up.</p>

<p>Thereupon Pap Curtain walked down to the rail
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
motioned the little jockey to him, and issued instructions:</p>

<p>“Turn dat Doodle-Bug aroun’, Jim, an’ back him
up to de startin’-place. He balks because he figgers
you is tryin’ to make him go aroun’ de track de wrong
way. Face him right an’ back him up, an’ when he
gits started, he’ll run like a rabbit!”</p>

<p>Skeeter and Sugar heard this advice, and it restored
Skeeter’s hopes in the horse. Sugar, anticipating
a share in Skeeter’s winnings, became extremely
gracious.</p>

<p>“Come an’ set down by me, Skeeter,” she said.
“You an’ Popper Curtain kin set on each side of me
an’ I’ll set in de middle. ’Tain’t no use fer you to be
jealousy of dat ole man. He’s ole enough to be my
daddy, an’ I’s jes’ bein’ gentle to him. I’s dead
stuck on you!”</p>

<p>Pap Curtain joined them, and the three sat down
to watch the race.</p>

<p>Doodle-Bug got a flying start, and did well for a
quarter; he was running second at the half; he took
last place at the three-quarters’ post, and came in
after all the shouting was over, jeered by a few children
as he loped past the grand stand.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts crumpled up beside Sugar Sibley, in
the saddest of all the plights which a lover experiences&mdash;dead
broke!</p>

<p>Pap Curtain got the giggles.</p>

<p>Sugar Sibley pretended not to notice when Skeeter
Butts arose and slunk away.</p>

<p>The racing was over for the day, and Sugar Sibley
rode back to Tickfall in Pap Curtain’s hired buggy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>“Pa Curtain is done played a buzzo on me, an’
I wants revengeance,” Skeeter Butts soliloquized
bitterly, as he sat behind the bar of the Hen-Scratch
saloon.</p>

<p>The swinging doors were thrust open, and Hitch
Diamond, Mustard Prophet, Prince Total, and Figger
Bush entered the room.</p>

<p>“We wants our money back, Skeeter,” they
announced in a chorus.</p>

<p>“Yo’ credick is good fer ten dollars per each, niggers,”
Butts said with a sickly grin. “I bet on
Doodle-Bug an’ Doodle didn’t do.”</p>

<p>There was a whoop from the four negroes, then
each handed Skeeter certain derogatory remarks
calculated to reduce his self-esteem to the minimum.</p>

<p>“Pap Curtain tipped me off on Doodle,” Skeeter
said defensively. “I don’t know nothin’ ’bout
pickin’ em.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of surprised silence; then
Hitch asked:</p>

<p>“Did you pay him for de tip, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly. He charged me fo’ bits.”</p>

<p>“Dat sho’ is curious,” Hitch said in a perplexed
tone. “Now Pap gib me a tip on dat race an’ he
said Dixie would win.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s whut he tole us,” Mustard and Figger
chimed in.</p>

<p>“I don’t kotch on to dat,” Prince Total declared.
“Pap sold me a tip on dat same race, an’ he said
Rooster would win.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Skeeter Butts grunted, “dat shows whut
a slick-head nigger Pap is. He wucks it dis way&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
tole twenty niggers dat Doodle-Bug would win; den
he tole twenty mo’ niggers dat Dixie would win; den
he tole twenty yuther niggers dat Rooster would win&mdash;an’
dar warn’t but three hosses in de race. Of
co’se he picked a winner fer twenty of dem niggers,
an’ he picked a near winner fer twenty mo’, an’ he
tuck up cont’ibutions of fifty cents from sixty niggers,
an’ fawty of ’em come back to git anodder tip!”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” the quartet mourned in righteous
indignation. “Pap hadn’t oughter did us dataway!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s all right,” Skeeter said consolingly. “We
gits one mo’ day of racin’ to-morrer, an’ I’s doin’
some heavy thinkin’. When I gits my plan all ready,
ef you niggers will he’p, we’ll git Pap Curtain an’
’vide him up&mdash;hoofs, hide, horns, an’ taller!”</p>

<p>“We’s wid you, Skeeter!” they shouted. “You
kin sottle you’ owe-bills wid us when we ’vides up
Pap’s pickin’s.”</p>

<p>The men tramped out of the saloon, and ten minutes
later the door swung open again, admitting Pap
Curtain.</p>

<p>“De good Lawd is sho’ heerd my prayer,” Skeeter
murmured thankfully as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>Pap came straight to the bar, laid down a five-cent
piece, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Gimme a big beer, Skeeter.”</p>

<p>Skeeter set the drink upon the bar, then, under
pretense of wiping the bar with his rag, flicked the
coin so that it fell on the floor at Pap’s feet.</p>

<p>When Pap stooped to pick it up, Skeeter quietly
emptied the odorless contents of a tiny vial into the
glass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>“Put de nickel back in yo’ pocket, Pap,” Skeeter
said pleasantly when Pap tendered it again. “It’s
my treat. Less sot down at de table an’ cornverse
awhile.”</p>

<p>The two sat down, sipped their drinks for a moment,
then Skeeter remarked:</p>

<p>“Dat wus mighty bum racin’ we had to-day.”</p>

<p>“Shore wus,” Pap agreed. “Dar ain’t never no
real racehosses at dis fair. Ef a feller’s got a hoss
whut kin run a little, he picks the cockle-burs outen
his tail, fotches him to town, and enters him in de
race.”</p>

<p>“You come out powerful good, Pap,” the barkeeper
said admiringly. “You muss ’a’ made a
whole passel of money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, I done it,” Pap assured him, draining
his glass of liquor as he talked. “I didn’t bet none.
I jes’ sold tips. But I shore had bad luck wid dat
money at de las’.”</p>

<p>“Whut happened?” Skeeter inquired with great
interest.</p>

<p>“You remember dat Sugar Sibley you wus wid?
Well, suh, dat gal jes’ nachelly hoodooed me outen
eve’y dollar I had on me, excusin’ dis one poor,
lonesome nickel. She said she wus skeart I would
git in bad comp’ny an’ lose it!”</p>

<p>“My Gawd, Pap!” Skeeter exclaimed, springing
to his feet. “Whyn’t you tell me dat terr’ble news
sooner?”</p>

<p>Pap did not answer. His head fell forward on his
chest; his hands hung limply at his sides; he breathed
stertorously, with his mouth open.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>Skeeter ransacked Curtain’s pockets.</p>

<p>They still sagged from the weight of the coins they
had contained, but now&mdash;they assayed only one
five-cent piece!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hitch Diamond, admitted into the Hen-Scratch
saloon through the rear door early the next morning,
was horrified to see the unconscious form of
Pap Curtain lying on a pallet in the corner of the
room.</p>

<p>“Whut’s come to pass wid Pap?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Knock-out draps,” Skeeter answered disgustedly.</p>

<p>“When you gwine ’vide up de money?” Hitch
grinned.</p>

<p>“Ax Sugar Sibley,” Skeeter responded. “She
beat me to Pap’s pockets, an’ never lef’ me nothin’
but a buff’lo jitney.”</p>

<p>“Whar is dat Sugar Sibley?” Hitch asked
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Dat’s whut yo’ job is right now&mdash;find dat nigger
woman!”</p>

<p>“Whut’ll I do when I gits her?”</p>

<p>“Cote her servigerous!” Skeeter informed him.
“Find out whar she keeps dat money. Ax her whut’s
she gwine do wit it!”</p>

<p>“Dat looks like a dangersome woman to me,”
Hitch remarked uneasily. “Whar do she come
from, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows!” the barkeeper answered. “I’s
heerd her say somepin ’bout Baton Rouge. Mebbe
she stays dar. She made google eyes at me in de
grand stan’ an’ I tuck up wid her.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>“I’ll go out and make inquirements an’ see whut I
kin do,” Hitch said.</p>

<p>“When you find out somepin, come back an’ repote.”</p>

<p>Two hours later a buggy stopped in front of the
Hen-Scratch saloon and Sugar Sibley leaned out
like a drowsy stage-queen, and languidly called for
Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p>“’Mawnin’, honey,” she said graciously. “Is you
gwine out to de fair to-day?”</p>

<p>“Suttingly,” he told her. “Dis here is Nigger
Day.”</p>

<p>Sugar leaned over and whispered:</p>

<p>“Is you saw Popper Curtain dis mawnin’?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” Skeeter lied glibly.</p>

<p>The woman hesitated a moment as if debating her
next move. Then she said:</p>

<p>“Skeeter, dat little brown hand-satchel at my
foots is full of money. I wants you to keep dat coin
fer me until atter dinner an’ den fotch it out to de
races. I’s gwine bet big money on dem races to-day
an’ I wants you to do my runnin’ fer me. I wus
gwine ax Popper Curtain to do it, but he’s done made
hisse’f absent.”</p>

<p>Skeeter lifted the satchel out of the buggy with
an eager hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t say nothin’ to nobody, honey!” Sugar
cautioned with a smile as she drove away.</p>

<p>Skeeter sat down behind the bar with the satchel
of money between his feet and tried to think. This
last incident had nearly unsettled his reason.</p>

<p>After a long period of meditation he arose and tiptoed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
into the room where Pap Curtain lay and
examined the prostrate man long and attentively.
He shook him by the shoulder&mdash;not too hard. He
kicked him&mdash;gently. Then he remarked with great
satisfaction:</p>

<p>“He won’t wake up till mighty nigh dark. By
dat time de fair will be over an’ Sugar will be gone
away on de excussion, an’ I won’t know nothin’
a tall!”</p>

<p>When Skeeter entered the saloon again he found
Hitch Diamond waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Skeeter,” he said with an air of dejection, “I
foun’ dat nigger gal ridin’ ’roun’ town in a buggy, an’
she pronounce dat she ain’t gwine arm roun’ wid no
kind of nigger excusin’ a high-yaller coon like you.
She say she’s dead stuck on you, an’ she gimme de
go-down.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, Hitch,” Skeeter replied complacently.
“Dem arrangements I made wid you is all
called down. Me an’ Miss Sugar is done made a
trade.”</p>

<p>“Whar does I come in on de trade?”</p>

<p>“You comes in right now, Hitch,” Skeeter said
affably. “I’s gwine pay you dat ten dollars you
loant me.”</p>

<p>From the brown hand-satchel under the bar Skeeter
counted out ten silver dollars and passed the money
to his friend. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Now, Hitch, you go find dem yuther niggers I
owes an’ fetch ’em in here in a bunch, because I
wants to talk to all of you an’ fix up a plan.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Hitch re-entered the room, followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
by Prince Total, Mustard Prophet, and Figger
Bush.</p>

<p>Out of Sugar’s hand-satchel Skeeter counted thirty
dollars, arranged them in piles of ten dollars each
and pushed them across the bar to the three negroes.</p>

<p>“Now, niggers,” Skeeter remarked, “I don’t owe
nary one of you nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” they exclaimed, pocketing the
money.</p>

<p>“Now you listen to me: Sugar Sibley specify dat
she’s gwine bet big to-day. I’s her runner. Now
you niggers git all de loose change you kin borry an’
steal an’ be out dar. Ef Sugar wins I’ll tip you-all
off whut her bet is. Ef Sugar lose I’ll place all her
bets wid you-alls, an’ atter de races is over us’ll ’vide
up.”</p>

<p>“Dem kind of exhort sho’ edifies my mind,
Skeeter,” Hitch Diamond boomed, “an’ us is wid
you!”</p>

<p>When the negroes had gone Skeeter counted the
money remaining in the hand-satchel. It was nearly
two hundred dollars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last day of the Tickfall fair was always given
over to the negroes. Every darky who had a horse
or mule was privileged to enter the animal for any race
without paying a fee.</p>

<p>Under such an arrangement the chief attraction
was the races, and the betting was wild and reckless.
There was no betting-shed, no bookmakers. The
gamblers circulated among their friends and placed
private bets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>

<p>Skeeter Butts was perfectly happy. Whenever
Sugar lost, he won; if Sugar won, it was no loss to
him.</p>

<p>“Five hosses runs in de nex’ race, niggers,” Skeeter
informed his fellow conspirators, in their operations
to separate Sugar Sibley from her money. “Sugar
bets on Hooligan. Ef Hooligan wins, each of you-alls
is gotter gimme two dollars an’ fo’ bits; ef Hooligan
lose, I splits dis ten-bill fo’ ways.”</p>

<p>Hooligan lost.</p>

<p>“Which hoss we gwine bet on nex’, Skeeter?”
Sugar laughed.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no good jedge,” Skeeter grinned. “I
foun’ out yistiddy dat sometimes dey runs bad an’
de nex’ time dey runs wuss.”</p>

<p>Three mules came loping down the track, and Sugar
picked Hot-Dog for a winner, instructing Skeeter to
place five dollars on that mule.</p>

<p>Hot-Dog started around the track as if he were
going to eat it up, grew weary of the journey at the
half-mile post, brayed, turned around, and galloped
back to the grand stand, meeting the other two mules
as they came under the wire.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the races Sugar Sibley began to
complain.</p>

<p>“I sho’ is had bad luck, Skeeter,” she mourned.
“Done bet my good money on five different races an’
ain’t winned a dollar. How come?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” Skeeter murmured. “Mebbe ef I go
down by de stables an’ pick up some tips&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Sugar snorted. “I done tried dat game
befo’. Down in Baton Rouge I made love to eve’y
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
nigger stable-boy, nigger rubber, nigger jockey, nigger
trainer, an’ nigger owner on de track.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t dey gib you no hot tips?”</p>

<p>“Shore! An’ eve’y time dey gimme a hot tip de
hoss I bet on got cold foots&mdash;but I got scorched good
an’ plenty!”</p>

<p>“Dey’s shore makin’ cracklin’ outen yo’ hide here,”
Skeeter snickered. “Dese niggers will all die water-millyunaires
ef yo’ pile holds out long enough.”</p>

<p>“I don’t keer,” Sugar said finally. “Dis here
money ain’t cost me nothin’, an’ ’tain’t no loss ef I
loses it.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de right talk,” Skeeter exclaimed. “Less
spend it all. I ain’t never wasted money like dis
befo’, an’ I likes de exoncise.”</p>

<p>“We’s got to waste it all on de nex’ race, den,”
Sugar snickered. “Dar ain’t but one mo’ race. Whut
hoss we gwine lose on now, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>A red-headed boy climbed up a ladder in front of
the starter’s stand to write the names of the horses
in the next race on a blackboard.</p>

<p>“De fust name he writes totes my money!” Sugar
proclaimed.</p>

<p>Then she watched a white hand chalking a scrawly
signature.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Sugar and Skeeter exclaimed in one
breath. “He’s done writ Doodle-Bug!”</p>

<p>With a tragic look on her face, Sugar Sibley
stooped down, picked up the brown hand-satchel
lying between her feet, and handed it to Skeeter
Butts.</p>

<p>“I’ll expire game, Skeeter!” she said in a weak,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
shaky voice. “Bet it all&mdash;dollar fer dollar! Dis
am de finish!”</p>

<p>Skeeter looked at her a moment, started to say
something, then walked away in silence. Once out
of her sight he ran with all speed in search of Hitch
Diamond, Prince Total, Mustard Prophet, and Figger
Bush.</p>

<p>“Git busy, niggers!” he howled. “Sugar bets
dollar fer dollar on Doodle-Bug!”</p>

<p>“She’ll git accommodated up!” Prince Total guffawed.
“Us niggers is gwine borry all de money
on dis fair ground.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t she jes’ hand us dat brown satchel?”
Figger Bush giggled.</p>

<p>“She wants some fun fer her money,” Skeeter
grinned. “She’s a real, true spote.”</p>

<p>“Let me be de stake-toter?” Hitch Diamond
giggled.</p>

<p>“Dat suits me,” Skeeter agreed. “Us’ll go up an’
stan’ by Sugar, an’ eve’y time dese yuther niggers
fetches you a dollar I’ll put one on top of it. Us’ll
do dis las’ race up in real good style.”</p>

<p>As Mustard and Prince and Figger made successive
trips through the crowd of negroes, coming
back each time with a little silver, Skeeter Butts
noted with uneasiness the absence of certain cheap
watches, brassy finger-rings, and gaudy, sparkling
scarf-pins.</p>

<p>Finally Figger Bush placed a fifty-cent piece against
Sugar’s choice and sighed:</p>

<p>“Ef dat Doodle wins Gawd knows whut <i>dis</i> dude’ll
do! I’s done bet de barlow-knife outen my pocket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
an’ borried money on dese very clothes I wears. I’s
plum busted, popped open, cleant out!”</p>

<p>Three horses loped up toward the starting pole.</p>

<p>Skeeter observed with satisfaction that Doodle-Bug
balked right in front of the grand stand, that half
a dozen men tried to make him move and failed, that
the little jockey was bucked off, and that Doodle-Bug
finally turned a complete somersault, landing on
his back.</p>

<p>“Doodle-Bug is actin’ in form,” Skeeter grinned.</p>

<p>“He’ll run like a skint rabbit!” Sugar Sibley
exclaimed, licking out her tongue, which was as dry
as a shuck and felt as large as a doormat.</p>

<p>“I done seen him run!” Skeeter answered sarcastically.</p>

<p>The little negro jockey, mindful of the instructions
received from Pap Curtain the day before, stood in
front of the ugly tempered Tuckapoo mustang, slashing
at the animal’s knees with his whip.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the horse moved backward step by
step, and thus the jockey finally worked him to the
starting place.</p>

<p>There was a mighty roar from the crowd, which
became a thunderous clamor at the starter’s word:</p>

<p>“<i>Go!</i>”</p>

<p>Sugar Sibley, who had sat unmoved amid the losses
of the entire afternoon, suddenly sprang to her feet,
ran down to the rail, shrieking like a calliope, begging
for Doodle-Bug to run, praying for Doodle-Bug to
win, her wailing cry, like the clear notes of a trumpet,
heard above the gigantic ululation of the crowd:</p>

<p>“<i>Go, Doodle, go!</i>”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>And Doodle went!</p>

<p>At the quarter pole he was two lengths ahead; at
the half he led by five lengths; at the three-quarter
pole the two other horses were trailing one hundred
yards behind. Doodle-Bug came under the wire
so far in advance that half the people had left the
grand stand for their homeward trip before the other
horses arrived!</p>

<p>Faint, weak, giddy, Sugar Sibley staggered back to
Skeeter Butts, reeling like a drunkard, clutching at
her throat for its hoarseness, dripping with perspiration,
her eyeballs burning like coals of fire.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” Skeeter moaned. “Whut’s done
gone an’ happened to dat Doodle-Bug?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’!” Sugar Sibley panted. “Doodle’s all
right. Doodle belongs to me. He was riz an’ borned
on my little farm an’ my chile Jimmy is a ridin’ him.
Us always makes a killin’ on Nigger Day at the parish
fairs.”</p>

<p>She took the empty brown hand-satchel out of
Skeeter’s nerveless hands and opened it.</p>

<p>“Pour dat money in dis bag, Hitch!” she commanded.
Then she uttered a wail, collapsed into a
heap upon the seat, and her mouth dropped open like
an imbecile’s.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond had mysteriously disappeared!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dizzy, nauseated, sweating at every pore, Pap
Curtain sat up in the middle of his pallet in the rear
room of the Hen-Scratch saloon, his tongue as dry
and thick as if his mouth were filled with cotton-seed
hulls. He moved his head and an iron wedge rolled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
off the apex of his crown and bumped against the inside
of his cranium like a rock rattles in a tin can.</p>

<p>“He’p! Come here, eve’body!” he bawled, balancing
his head and steadying it with both hands to
keep the wedge from bumping against a new place.</p>

<p>“Little Bit&mdash;Lawdymussy! My head hurts inside
and outside!” he howled to the diminutive assistant
barkeeper of the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p>Little Bit stood beside him, giggling, holding out a
half-pint flask.</p>

<p>“Skeeter Butts say gib you dis as soon as you
woked up!” he said.</p>

<p>Pap took the bottle, removed the cork; then his
hand drooped limply, his head dropped to one side,
and the precious fluid was pouring out upon the
pallet.</p>

<p>“Hey, dar!” Little Bit shrieked, rescuing the liquid
from total loss and kicking Pap into consciousness.
“Git up an’ drink dis med’cine!”</p>

<p>Pap swallowed the contents of the bottle, then
asked:</p>

<p>“Whut time is it, Little Bit?”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty nigh night.”</p>

<p>“Whut day is dis?”</p>

<p>“It’s jes’ de same day whut it’s been since mawnin’,”
Little Bit informed him.</p>

<p>“Whut does you call it?” Pap howled impatiently.</p>

<p>“I calls it to-day,” Little Bit answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, lawdymussy!” Pap bawled. “Whut a
fool!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s right!” Little Bit agreed innocently.
“You shore is been a whopper!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>Then the medicine which Skeeter prescribed began
to take effect, and Pap Curtain felt the revival of his
faculties and his strength. He staggered to his feet,
stumbled out of the rear door, and disappeared. He
went straight to the home of Sugar Sibley, and found
Sugar in the wildest hysterics.</p>

<p>Weepingly she told him the tale of her gains and
of her great loss. Pap could sympathize with her, for
on the day before he had experienced both himself.</p>

<p>Finally Pap said:</p>

<p>“Shut up, Sugar. You done lamented a plenty.
Dem niggers whut stole dat money is gone out to de
old fish-camp to ’vide it up. Ef you rides out dar
right now, you kin ketch ’em at it!”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Sugar Sibley stopped Doodle-Bug
behind a thicket at the old fishing camp on the
Dorforche Bayou, and peered over the top of the
bushes where she could hear masculine voices in hot
debate.</p>

<p>In fact, it had been a day of such frenzied finance
for the five negroes that an expert accountant could
not have told what would be an equitable division
of their spoils. So the thieves had fallen out, and
their voices were raised to high pitch.</p>

<p>What Sugar saw filled her heart with hope and
gladness.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts, with a pile of money lying between
his knees, was sitting on the ground, four other negroes
watching the count, stopping at intervals to
quarrel, but listening to the refrain of Skeeter as it
crooned to the musical accompaniment of falling
coins:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p>“A dollar fer me, a dollar fer Hitch, a dollar fer
Mustard, a dollar fer Figger, an’ a dollar fer Prince!”</p>

<p>Their business was interrupted by a loud whoop.</p>

<p>A Tuckapoo mustang with a white face thrashed
through the underbrush, and Sugar Sibley swept
down upon them like an avenging fury, flourishing
an immense pistol which cracked three times, the
bullets kicking the dirt into the faces of the stooping
men.</p>

<p>The five men, leaving their money untouched, got
up and went away from the place with astonishing
speed.</p>

<p>Sugar dismounted, crammed her money into her
brown hand-satchel, jumped on the back of Doodle-Bug,
and rode away.</p>

<p>An hour later, as the five weary, disconsolate men
trailed back to town, they noticed in front of Pap
Curtain’s cabin a Tuckapoo mustang with a white
face.</p>

<p>Pap sat upon the porch, his mouth filled with
chewing-tobacco and his heart filled with vast content.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts spoke. “Pap is you saw anything
of Sugar Sibley?”</p>

<p>“Suttinly,” Pap answered. “She’s layin’ in my
cabin on de bed, takin’ a little nap.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t married to her, is you?” Skeeter asked
after a moment of meditation.</p>

<p>“Who? Me?” Pap Curtain roared. “Naw! Sugar
is my gal! <i>I’m her daddy!</i> Don’t you remember my
gal, Skeeter? Dey used to call her Sweet befo’ her
maw lef’ me an’ went down to Baton Rouge.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>Skeeter did not answer, and the gloomy procession
moved on. Finally Skeeter Butts mumbled:</p>

<p>“Yes, I remembers dat gal when she warn’t
more’n hawn-high to a billy-goat. But I’s had expe’unce
dis day dat eve’thing ain’t sweet whut’s called
Sugar!”

<h2 id="Every_Pose_a_Picture">Every Pose a Picture</h2>


<h3>I<br />

AN ALL-COON CAST</h3>

<p>Mr. Shirley Rouke was one of the first-born sons
of the silent drama.</p>

<p>The first moving picture ever thrown upon a screen
in the city of New Orleans was projected by the
capable hand of this red-headed Irishman.</p>

<p>In the famous resort known as West End, on Lake
Pontchartrain, half of the inhabitants of the Crescent
City assembled to watch the revelation of a two-hundred
foot film which showed a man walking down
the street, a dog trotting across the street and a horse
and buggy going up the street!</p>

<p>Thrilled by this vision, the people roared their
applause until the porpoises sporting far out in the
lake dived for deep water.</p>

<p>In a short time the thrill and novelty of a plotless
jumble of pictures wore off, and Mr. Rouke was
quick to inform the Gitagraft Company that the
people wanted stories&mdash;the pictures must have a
punch and tell a tale. Then came an era of real
plays and real actors and dramatized novels and scenarios
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
written by authors whose names were famous
across the continent.</p>

<p>“Do the newest thing first!” was Rouke’s motto.
His active brain devised novelties like a liver secretes
bile, and after each sensational innovation the Gitagraft
Company counted its receipts, raised Rouke’s
salary, and told him to go the extreme end of the
limit.</p>

<p>Just as the theatrical managers delight to announce
an all-star aggregation of actors, so Shirley Rouke
had been the first motion picture director to feature
an All-Native picture showing the native haunts
and the natural characteristics of one race or tribe
of people and using the natives and actors in the
films.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Rocky Mountains he produced
an All-Indian picture. In the far north, where the
midnight sun casts a shadow on the snow, he got an
All-Eskimo picture. At the entrance of the Shoguns’
temple in Tokio he began an all-Japanese
picture which moved in exquisite beauty through the
blossom-laden cherry groves, the wistaria-festooned
tea houses, across the sacred bridge at Nikko, and
ended at last with the happy lovers climbing the
Jacob’s Ladder on the island of Enoshima.</p>

<p>He had just returned from China with an all-Chinese
picture which began in the Botanical Gardens
of Hong-kong, concluded its first reel at the
Temple of Confucius in Canton&mdash;“One Minute
Please!”&mdash;sailed down the Canton River on a Chinese
flower boat, and concluded its fifth reel with a
public execution on the northern frontier of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
Mongolian Empire under the shadow of the Great
Wall.</p>

<p>He was now taking a two days’ rest in the office on
Fifth Avenue and looking around for more worlds to
conquer when, lo!&mdash;</p>

<p>“Niggers!” he bawled, springing to his feet and
slapping the back of Peter Pellet, his camera artist.
“An All-Coon Cast! Pack up your night-shirt,
Peter! Us for the slimy cypress sloughs of the Sunny
South!”</p>

<p>Peter Pellet’s participation in Rouke’s wild innovations
had taught him that life, like his name, was a
pill. He swallowed it loyally, but he reserved the
inalienable right to petition and protest whenever
Rouke grabbed him by the nose, pried open his mouth,
and offered him another bitter dose.</p>

<p>“Aw ferget it!” he began. “A nigger can’t act.
The nigger minstrels are all white men.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Rouke agreed. “But they imitate niggers.
That’s what makes them so funny. Nigger
minstrels make a hit all over this country. Oh, sugar!
the latest line of laugh looseners! Be ready, Pete!
We leave on the night train.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what part of the South you expect to
invade?” Peter inquired in a sour tone.</p>

<p>“We’ll honor the Pelican State with our presence,”
Rouke grinned. “I know a man who knows niggers
just like he had been a red corpuscle of their blood
and had gone all through ’em. His name is Gaitskill,
and he’s the loudest tick at Tickfall, Louisiana.”</p>

<p>Four days later Mr. Shirley Rouke sat beside the
mahogany table in the office of Colonel Tom Gaitskill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
president of the Tickfall bank, and told him of
his plans.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about negroes, Mr.
Rouke?” Gaitskill inquired.</p>

<p>“Not a dang thing!” Rouke grinned. “Their
faces and hands are black and I presume they are
also black under their clothes, but I don’t know.
All of them seem to answer promptly to the name of
George. The Pullman porters are accommodating
everywhere except in Mississippi, which has an anti-tipping
law. I spent a month in New Orleans about
twenty years ago, but didn’t get chummy with any
smokes.”</p>

<p>“Your education has been sadly neglected,” Gaitskill
laughed. “But you are now in a fair way to
overcome its defects. Sir, you have my sincerest
sympathy.”</p>

<p>“If you mean you are sorry for me, I don’t see any
cause for your heart-break,” Rouke declared. “This
is a simple business proposition. I’ll look around a
little, get my locations, write my scenario, employ
my actors, pay ’em a good salary, take my pictures
and hike!”</p>

<p>“It sounds easy,” Gaitskill remarked gravely.</p>

<p>Then he laughed. Finally he asked: “Did you ever
see a photograph of a negro?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I’ve seen Booker T.’s mug!”</p>

<p>“He don’t count,” Gaitskill said. “It’s a long,
long way to Tuskegee, and these niggers around here
could not pronounce that word if they practiced for a
week.”</p>

<p>The door opened and a squat-legged, pot-bellied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
negro entered, removing his hat. His head was bald
except for a tuft of moss-like hair growing above
each ear, making him look like a fat-faced mule wearing
a blind bridle. His thick lips pouted like the lips
of a fretted child.</p>

<p>“What’s aching now, Vinegar?” Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p>“Marse Tom, ’bout dat left-handed screw driver
dat you sont me out to borrer dis mawnin’; de black-smif
tole me dat he loant it to Sheriff Flournoy, an’ de
sheriff tole me dat Doc Moseley done borrered it, an’
Doc Moseley tole me dat he had Hitch Diamond
wuckin’ wid it because Hitch already had such a
powerful lef’ hook, an’ I hunted up Hitch an’ Hitch
tole me I wus a dam’ ole fool. Hitch specify dat
dar ain’t no sech thing as a left-handed screw
driver!”</p>

<p>Gaitskill began to cough violently and ran to the
window for fresh air, where he could also conceal his
face from Vinegar Atts by turning his back.</p>

<p>To Mr. Rouke that cough sounded like a smothered
laugh, but he had no interest in a screw driver
and concentrated his attention on the negro.</p>

<p>Gaitskill had almost recovered from his fake cough
when he chanced to turn his head and see Mr. Rouke.
That brilliant New Yorker was gazing at Vinegar
Atts with a scrutiny so intense, so penetrating that it
seemed to go beneath the negro’s skin and pierce to
the very marrow of his bones; while Vinegar gazed
back into the Irishman’s blue orbs with the vacuous
solemnity of a horse. That started Gaitskill in
another fit of coughing.</p>

<p>Finally Gaitskill said:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry I put you to so much trouble, Vinegar.
Here’s a half dollar to pay you for your work.”</p>

<p>“Wus you prankin’ wid me, Marse Tom?” Vinegar
asked, as he pocketed the silver.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Gaitskill grinned. “How could I know
there was no such thing as a left-handed screw
driver?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so,” Vinegar agreed. “Nobody cain’t
find out nothin’ ’thout axin’.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you happened in just now, Vinegar,”
Gaitskill said, changing the subject. “This gentleman
sitting here is Mr. Shirley Rouke of New York
City.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet yo’ ’quaintance,” Vinegar mumbled.</p>

<p>Rouke rose and held out his hand.</p>

<p>Gaitskill watched Vinegar with a smile: a negro
positively hates to shake hands with any white man
who is not his personal friend.</p>

<p>Vinegar looked down at Rouke’s hand, then
reached out and caught hold of it about as a man
would handle the tail of a vicious rat.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you,” Rouke murmured, to whom
this comedy was hidden.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s right, suh!” Vinegar responded.</p>

<p>“Vinegar Atts is a preacher, Mr. Rouke,” Gaitskill
remarked. “He is the leader of the negro race
in Tickfall. I suggest that you talk over your plans
with him and engage him to help you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Colonel,” Rouke said. “And now, not
to detain you longer from your business, I’ll take a
walk with Atts and we’ll have a talk.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<p>“My automobile is at your service,” Gaitskill
said, as he shook hands. “I’ll be glad to help you in
any way. Make yourself at home in this office.”</p>

<p>When the door closed behind this oddly assorted
pair, Gaitskill broke out in a loud laugh.</p>


<h3>II<br />

AN ART TO ART TALK</h3>

<p>“Boss,” Vinegar inquired, the moment they
stepped out of the bank, “is you gwine converse me
’bout some kind of wuck?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have a little proposition which&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please, suh, less you an’ me go somewheres an’
set down,” Vinegar pleaded in a tone which throbbed
with fatigue. “Nothin’ don’t make me as tired as
talkin’ ’bout wuck.”</p>

<p>Vinegar led him through the narrow, winding
streets of the negro settlement known as Dirty-Six,
and conducted him finally to the Shoofly church.
Opening the door, he brought out two rickety chairs,
placed them in the shade of a chinaberry tree,
sighed audibly, and sat down. Rouke placed his
chair against the trunk of the tree and leaned back.</p>

<p>“Now, boss, beller dem sad news to me easy!”
Vinegar admonished. “Don’t fergit it offen yo’
mind dat my maw fetched me up meek an’ mild an’
de good Lawd called me to preach. A real, stiddy
job of reg’lar wuck would shore bust my cornstitution
down.”</p>

<p>Being totally unaccustomed to negro whimsicalities,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Mr. Shirley Rouke listened to this without a
smile. His cool, steady eyes gazed at Vinegar
deliberately, appraisingly, captiously, and Vinegar
felt the fountains of fun turn dry as dust within him.
This man would not take any nigger foolishness.</p>

<p>Without knowing it, Rouke had made his task
doubly hard by causing Vinegar to feel ill at ease.</p>

<p>“I’m a motion picture director and producer for
the Gitagraft Company,” Rouke began in a voice
which clicked like the keys of a typewriter. “I
want to produce an All-Negro picture, und’stand? I
want you to help me get the actors and extras, help
me to find my locations, give me the right steer on
everything, and dope out everything I need to know
about the blacks, see?”</p>

<p>There was one minute of perfect silence. Vinegar
broke out in a profuse perspiration. He removed
his hat, placed it on the ground, wiped the sweat off
the top of his bald head by the simple process of rubbing
the sleeve of his coat over it, and sighed like a
bellows. Then he asked timidly:</p>

<p>“Boss, would you mind pourin’ all dem buckshots
back in de pouch? Dey rattled an’ spluttered all
aroun’ me, but dey didn’t hit nowhar.”</p>

<p>“How’s that? I don’t get you!” Rouke snapped.</p>

<p>The two gazed at each other like glass-eyed china
dogs, both devoid of comprehension. Then Vinegar
wailed:</p>

<p>“Marse Tom hadn’t oughter shoved me inter dis
jam. Mebbe ef he’d tole me ’bout dis hisself, I might
could ketch on!”</p>

<p>“I don’t get you!” Rouke barked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s right!” Vinegar assured him.</p>

<p>Rouke slapped the upper pocket of his fancy waistcoat,
snatched out two fat cigars, and held them out
to Vinegar Atts. Without knowing it, he had made
an overwhelming hit!</p>

<p>Vinegar took a cigar, carefully removed the large
purple and gold band, placed it on his little finger,
held up his gorilla-like hand and gazed at the ornament
as admiringly as a maiden views her engagement
ring. Then he leaned back and puffed the
smoke in a cloud around his head.</p>

<p>“Dis shore is a good stogie, boss,” he remarked.
“I’s powerful sorry dar ain’t no women folks aroun’
to see me smoke it. It makes me feel a whole heap
better. Whut did you say you done fer a livin’?”</p>

<p>“I make moving pictures,” Rouke answered.</p>

<p>“Movin’&mdash;which?” Vinegar asked.</p>

<p>“Moving pictures,” Rouke repeated in a sharp
tone. “Didn’t you ever see any movies?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, mebbe so, suh, when I wus a little
shaver, ‘way back befo’ de war. But I ain’t seem to
rickoleck nothin’ ’bout it.”</p>

<p>“Aw, gosh!” Rouke snapped. “Are you kidding
me?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, dunno, suh, ’spose not, suh.”</p>

<p>The Gitagraft Company suffered an inestimable
loss by not having a camera artist present at this
interview to preserve the facial expressions of these
two men as they sat glaring at each other. Finally
a gleam of intelligence penetrated the armor-plated
skull of Vinegar, and he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>“Boss, it ’pears like you an’ me don’t sop gravy

outen de same dish. When you talks, nothin’ don’t
specify; an’ when I talks my argumint don’t show
wharin. Us is bofe jes’ wuckin’ our jaws widout
chawin’ no cud. Whut I axes you is dis: Does you
sells pictures or does you takes pictures?”</p>

<p>“I takes pictures,” Shirley grinned.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Vinegar grinned back. “Now us is
bofe lickin’ offen de same spoon. You keep yo’
mouf sot till I axes you anodder ’terrogation: Is dese
here movin’ pictures jes’ de same as livin’ pictures?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I suppose so,” Rouke answered, wondering
how he could explain to the negro without
getting him all balled up again.</p>

<p>“Ef dat’s so, den I understand whut you signifies,”
Vinegar boomed. “A feller come to my chu’ch
las’ year an’ he had somepin like dat. He had a
Noer’s Ark, an’ de Chillum of Israel, an’ a Daniel in
de lions’ pen&mdash;an’ dat wus all pretty pious an’ proper.
But atter dat, he had whut he called a <i>Tablow Vevong</i>
of livin’ pictures, an’ I didn’t favor ’em much. He
put some black little tight underclothes on me an’
made me stand in a wash tub an’ called me ‘September
Mawn.’”</p>

<p>“Aw, hell!” Shirley Rouke remarked. “That
ain’t it at all.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, boss,” Vinegar said in troubled tones. “I
figgered dat us wus jes’ ’bout to ketch on to each
yuther.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you colored persons ever put on any
plays?” Rouke inquired.</p>

<p>“Does you mean do us pull off any shows?” Vinegar
asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Suttinly, boss. Us gin a show las’ week.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” Rouke declared. “Now a moving
picture is simply a show, a play, all the parts taken
an’ acted by colored persons, and while they are playing
we will take pictures of them. See?”</p>

<p>“I sees!”</p>

<p>“The actors won’t have a thing to do with the
pictures. They only play the parts which I teach
them. Und’stand?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you gwine gib us no koodak shotsnaps of
ourse’ves?” Vinegar demanded in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” Rouke assented in an acidulous voice.
“Any dang little thing to please. Do you think you
could round me up a bunch of colored people who
would like to act in a show?”</p>

<p>“Git ’em?” Vinegar bellowed. “Boss, my job is
gwine be to keep ’em away! When de news gits
aroun’ dat eve’y nigger gits a free picture of hisse’f
an’ a chance to speak a piece on de flatform&mdash;Mister
Man, I tells you honest&mdash;us better keep dis a secret!
You’ll wear yo’ koodak plum’ out takin’ nigger
pictures!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Rouke agreed. “Keep it quiet.
Don’t tell anybody except those you want in the
play. See? Now let’s discuss terms.”</p>

<p>“Cuss&mdash;which?”</p>

<p>“Talk money!” Rouke barked.</p>

<p>Vinegar’s face fell.</p>

<p>“I thought de pictures wus free!” he protested.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean that!” Rouke grated through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
his teeth. “Listen! I want to know how much you
will charge me to get the actors for the play and help
me stage it. Get that?”</p>

<p>“I ketch on!” Vinegar beamed. “You wants to
make a trade. Well, suh, when Marse Tom wants
me to git him some plantation hands, he pays me one
dollar apiece per each nigger an’ one dollar per day
extry fer knowin’ whar dey is at an’ how to argufy
’em loose from de yuther planters.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you two dollars for every negro I employ
in the play and five dollars a week for wages. When
I see the actors, I’ll arrange rates with them. Is
that all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat shore sounds like free charity,”
Vinegar agreed.</p>

<p>“What about a contract?” Rouke asked.</p>

<p>“A which?”</p>

<p>“A contract&mdash;a writing&mdash;write up the agreement!”
Rouke explained.</p>

<p>“You means a obscribe!” Vinegar said. “Naw,
suh, ’tain’t wuth writin’ up. Niggers don’t favor
obscribes. Us gits in lawsuits wid de cotehouse when
us scratches on paper. Ef you pays us eve’y day, us
niggers will wuck. Ef de pay stops, restin’ time is
done come.”</p>

<p>“Very good!” Rouke said, as he rose from his
chair. “Go out now and get all the niggers who have
ever acted in a show. Tell them to meet me here tomorrow
morning at nine o’clock. I’ll see you then.
So long!”</p>

<p>He turned and walked back toward the village of
Tickfall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>Vinegar watched him until he disappeared from
view; then he said:</p>

<p>“Dat’s a nice white man, but more’n half de time
his mouf don’t understan’ his mind. Eve’y time I
esplained to him whut he wus tryin’ to say, he specify
dat wusn’t it!”</p>

<p>Rouke returned to his hotel, opened the door to his
room, and found the chair by his typewriter pre-empted
by Peter Pellet.</p>

<p>“What’s the grouch, Pete?” Rouke demanded.
“You got a pout on your mug like a camel. I bet
you can’t walk without stepping on your lip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sugar, Shirley,” Peter mourned. “I just
came in to tell you what a hellarious town this Tickfall
is. During the day the men just sit in front of the
stores and chew tobacco and kid the niggers. If a
dog-fight happens the town gets so excited the doctors
are called out to quiet their nerves. At night the
whole bunch goes home and goes to bed. If it ain’t
so, you may hang my body on a sour apple tree. I
asked one of ’em what they did on Sunday and he
said they went to church! What do you know about
that? Two days of dissipation have dragged me
down, Shirley&mdash;I’m a faint and feeble frazzle! Fan
me with a brick!”</p>

<p>“Aw, can that!” Rouke growled. “Have you
been out finding those locations I told you about?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” Peter answered, and now his tone
changed to admiration. “These swamps are the real
thing, Shirley. I saw a jungle so thick that a raccoon
could not crawl through it without scraping all
the hair off of his tail. I saw a lake that’s got no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
bottom, one side of it hot water and the other cold.
I saw mosquitoes as big as a daddy longlegs&mdash;felt
’em, too; when they bite they feel like a red-hot poker
and when you slap ’em you are a murderer with a
raw and bleeding corpse upon your hands!”</p>

<p>“I saw a swamp rattlesnake five feet long, big
around as my leg, full of fight as Jess Willard or Jesse
James, and hungry enough to manifest a carnivorous
desire for my acquaintance, but I moved the free
lunch about forty feet away before he got a bite. I
found a place where you could stick a pole down in the
swamp mud, pull it out all dripping with water, and
light it like a torch&mdash;the mud is so full of gas. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” Rouke said. “Order that
reel from New Orleans to come up to-night and fix it
up with the movie man so we can show it to-morrow
morning!”</p>

<p>Left alone with his typewriter, Rouke slipped a
sheet of paper in the machine and wrote:</p>


<p class="caption large">THE JEWEL OF THE JUNGLE</p>

<p>“Gee,” he grinned, as he began his scenario,
“that’s an utterly wretched title, I don’t think!”</p>


<h3>III<br />

THE MOVING PICTURE WRITES</h3>

<p>When Rouke entered the Shoofly church next
morning, he found the pulpit chair occupied by the
Reverend Vinegar Atts, while forty of his parishioners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
sat in mute and reverent attitude in the pews.</p>

<p>Rouke stood for a moment in the dusty, smelly,
dilapidated building, gazed at the rude benches
scrawled with names and dates and letters, and at the
windows whose broken panes had been mended by
different colored glass, and his artistic soul got a cold
chill. The place looked like a morgue and the occupants
reminded him of stiffs.</p>

<p>“Bring your congregation out in front, Atts!” he
called. “I want to see ’em in the sunlight!”</p>

<p>Standing in the churchyard, Rouke got his first
look at some of our old acquaintances: Skeeter Butts,
small, wiry, dressy, his face saddle-colored, his hair
close-cropped with the part in the middle made by a
razor, his shirt-collar so high that he resembled a
sorrel mule looking over a whitewashed fence; Figger
Bush, with his kinky wool, his ratlike eyes, and his
shoe-brush mustache; Hitch Diamond, massive, solid,
built like a rock quarry; and a dozen more men and a
score of women filed out behind them and stood
about the steps of the church.</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts suddenly left his place, passed
around to the other end of the group, and stood close
beside a certain girl.</p>

<p>Rouke, watching him, found in that moment the
bright particular gem for the Jewel of the Jungle.</p>

<p>Lalla Cordona was well worth looking at.</p>

<p>She stood among the others as distinct as a polished
diamond lying in a slag-heap, slim and straight as a
javelin, graceful as a stalk of waving corn, the features
of her coal-black face as clear-cut as a cameo,
her flexible, expressive lips curling smilingly over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
absolutely flawless teeth&mdash;she was as exquisite as a
statue carved in ebony by the hands of Beauty and
Grace.</p>

<p>But over all and through all there poured the flame,
the personal magnetism of the girl, that unanalyzable
something which makes the perfect moving
picture type&mdash;the fire, the soul, which glows in the
eyes, quivers in the cheek, distends the nostrils, curls
the lip, or when the lip is still, reposes there, making
the lip palpitant with its presence.</p>

<p>As for Skeeter Butts, love had made him a fool.
No beggar ever groveled before a princess at the
distribution of alms, no dog ever fawned before his
mistress, as Skeeter acted in the presence of this
ebon divinity.</p>

<p>“Skeeter’s done kotch it at las’,” Hitch Diamond
grinned, as he watched the infatuated barkeeper.
“He acts as proud as a monkey wid a tin tail, an’ as
shy as a houn’ pup whut’s tumbled in a bucket of
tar!”</p>

<p>“She’s sot up shiny and purty jes’ like a autermobile,
ain’t she?” Figger Bush remarked in admiring
tones.</p>

<p>“Huh,” Hitch Diamond grinned, “eve’y woman is
sot up jes’ like a autermobile. A autermobile costs
money to git it, an’ it costs money to keep it, an’
when it takes a notion to stop nothin’ cain’t make it
go, an’ when somepin gits de matter wid it, not even
Gawd knows whut de trouble am. Ain’t dat jes’ like
a woman?”</p>

<p>This edifying dissertation was terminated by the
stentorian voice of Vinegar Atts:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>“Eve’ybody listen to me: dis here white gen’leman
is named Mr. Rouke. He specify dat he gits up
shows an’ takes koodaks fer a livin’. He wants us
niggers to he’p him. Eve’ybody gits a free picture.
Eve’ybody is ’lowed to speak a piece on de platform.
Eve’ybody gits a few loose change fer deir time an’
wuck. I now resigns in Mr. Rouke’s favor!”</p>

<p>Vinegar sat down on the church steps and fanned
himself with his hat.</p>

<p>“I want to teach you folks to play a drama entitled
<i>The Jewel of the Jungle</i>,” Rouke announced in crisp
tones.</p>

<p>“Whut is a draymer?” Figger Bush wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“It’s a tragedy,” Rouke informed him. “Not a
funny play, but a show full of love and fighting, and
brave men and women.”</p>

<p>“Don’t us be allowed to bust no jokes in dis here
draymer?” Vinegar Atts wanted to know.</p>

<p>“No!” Rouke told him. “You won’t have to say
a word. You don’t talk. You act!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Skeeter Butts proclaimed. “You cain’t
git up no lock-jaw play wid niggers. Ef a nigger
cain’t whistle and sing and pat his foots, he’d druther
be dead!”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” Rouke said sharply.
“This is a motion picture play. Didn’t any of you
folks ever see a movie show?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh!” came a chorus of voices.</p>

<p>“All right!” Rouke answered. “Follow me and
I’ll take you down to the theater and show you one!”</p>

<p>The negroes fell in line, and Rouke led them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
through the mazes of Dirty-Six, up the main streets
of Tickfall and into the little theater.</p>

<p>Peter Pellet was perched aloft, having made all
arrangements with the owner of the house for this
exhibition.</p>

<p>The negroes seated themselves close to the front,
a circle of light flashed upon the screen, a slight
whirring sound came from the projection room and
a title fluttered before them:</p>


<h3>THE DANCE OF DEATH</h3>

<p>Then for twenty minutes the negroes were transported
to a tropic island in the South Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>They beheld a bamboo village, the little naked
children playing in front of the huts, the dogs lying
in the sun or slinking among the cooking-pots, the
men and women wearing the rude, barbaric garments
of the tribe, their legs and shoulders bare.</p>

<p>They witnessed the preparation for a great feast,
the camp filling up with wild, cruel savages, both
men and women.</p>

<p>Then the village princess danced before them, a
frenzied whirl of bare arms and bare limbs, while a
band of musicians beat upon rude instruments
whose melody they could not hear.</p>

<p>They beheld a white man appear upon this scene,
peep at the dancing princess, through the interstices
of the jungle, fall in love with her infatuating grace
and beauty, and later seek her out in her bamboo hut.</p>

<p>Betrayed by her white lover, the Black Swan sought
revenge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p>The white man was captured, bound to a stake,
and in the midst of a horrible revelry of torture a
posse of white men arrived, rescued the victim of
savage hate, slaughtered most of the inhabitants of
the village, burned the bamboo huts and departed.</p>

<p>But the Black Swan had escaped the slaughter,
and the negroes watched her with breathless interest
as she trailed the rescue party until they came to a
narrow defile in the mountains. She climbed the
mountain side and stood, at last, silhouetted against
the sky, as graceful as the bird whose name she bore,
looking down upon the posse in the valley below.
She called to her faithless lover, hurled a javelin
through his body, then turned and fled, leaping like a
deer from rock to rock.</p>

<p>With tense bodies and aching eyes, the negroes
watched the flight of the girl and the pursuit of the
posse until the girl was cornered, stopping at last
on a high, sharp crag, overlooking the sea.</p>

<p>Then as the rifle bullets of the pursuing mob
splashed against the rock at her feet she poised like a
bird prepared for flight, leaped far out from the precipice,
curved like an arrow in its course, and plunged
head foremost into the rolling flood of the ocean
beneath.</p>

<p>The picture vanished and the negroes found themselves
looking with popping eyeballs at a bare, white
screen!</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Hitch Diamond bellowed in a mighty
voice. “Whut do Gawd A’mighty think about
dat?”</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” Figger Bush squawked. “Dat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
little gal dived so fur she’ll stick head down in de mud
in de bottom of dat puddle like a cypress stump!”</p>

<p>“Dat white man shore got his’n,” Vinegar remarked.
“’Tain’t no way fer a white man to do&mdash;hangin’
aroun’ nigger cabins like dat!”</p>

<p>The electric light flashed up, and Mr. Rouke,
stepped to the front.</p>

<p>“Now, folks,” he began, “you understand what a
moving picture play is. There is no talking. The
people act. I have a fine act for all of you to take
part in, and I want you to meet me at the Shoofly
church this afternoon at one o’clock. That’s all
now!”</p>

<p>The negroes filed out in silence and scattered to
different parts of the town.</p>

<p>Rouke and Pellet went to the hotel for lunch, and
at the time appointed walked out to the church.</p>

<p>There was not a negro on the place. They waited
for three hours and not one appeared, not even Vinegar
Atts.</p>

<p>They began a search for Atts, and found him
whitewashing a fence for Colonel Tom Gaitskill.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Atts? Why didn’t you
niggers show up?”</p>

<p>Vinegar wiped the splashes of whitewash off of his
black face and answered:</p>

<p>“Dey said dey didn’t want to come, boss.”</p>

<p>“Who said?”</p>

<p>“All of ’em, excusin’ dat little gal named Lalla
Cordona, whut says she visitin’ here from N’Awleens.
She wus game fer it, but nobody else wouldn’t mess
wid it no more!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>“Why not?” Rouke snapped.</p>

<p>“Dey say dey wusn’t gwine play no play whar de
white folks peeped at ’em through de bushes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aw, that’s not in the play&mdash;” Rouke began.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh ’tis! Dat’s wut de movin’ picture wrote
down on de wall at dat little theater&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but you don’t understand&mdash;where
are all those people?”</p>

<p>“Dey’s all gone out to Lake Basteneau fishin’,
boss. I’se gwine out as soon as I git dis fence whitewashed.
A new coon done come to town and tole me
he was de beau of dat Lalla Cordona. He’s done
fotch her a red ruben necklace an’ a ruben ring, an’
I guess dat’s so. He hired me to drive him out
dar.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go out there and bring them back,” Rouke
said.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t do no good, boss. Dey won’t ack. All
dem mens and womens say dey ain’t gwine do it.
Dey got conscience scruples.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>Vinegar scratched his head and answered, choosing
his words with care:</p>

<p>“Well, suh, dey is all agreed dat dey ain’t gwine
hab deir pictures took sashayin’ aroun’ in de woods
widout no pants on!”</p>

<p>Rouke sat down on the end of a log and fanned
himself with his hat. Then he said:</p>

<p>But why record what Shirley Rouke said?</p>

<p>Nothing but the <i>Diabolos Gazette</i> printed on asbestos
paper on O-hell street in Purgatory Bottom
would dare to publish the language of anger and disgust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
and exasperation to which Rouke gave vocal
utterance.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts, appalled to the core of his ecclesiastical
soul by this thunderous fulmination of anathema,
picked up his whitewash bucket and slunk away.</p>

<p>Turning a distant corner, he stopped and peeped
behind him.</p>

<p>“Lawdymussy!” he sighed. “Dat yuther man is
done j’ined in now! Dem white mens is shore tellin’
Gawd all about us niggers!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Rouke, having relieved his
mind, looked up and grinned at Pellet.</p>

<p>“Peter,” he said in a quiet voice, “would you
mind leading me to the private office of Colonel Tom
Gaitskill in the Tickfall bank? Since I’ve been
associating with the negro inhabitants of this village,
I don’t believe I have sense enough to find that office.”</p>


<h3>IV<br />

STUNT STUFF!</h3>

<p>Five personages arrived at the fishing camp on
Lake Basteneau early the next morning.</p>

<p>First came Rev. Vinegar Atts and Miss Cordona’s
New Orleans lover, the latter wearing clothes of the
newest model and a slick smile of the most recent duplicity&mdash;a
tall, slim, smooth-faced negro of the typical
Ethiopian features and the air of a race-track tout.</p>

<p>Next came Miss Lalla Cordona in a hired buggy, as
dressy as a cheap Christmas doll, radiant with smiles
and quivering with vivacity and vital magnetism.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

<p>Then an automobile puffed along the swamp road
and stopped in front of the camp and Shirley Rouke
and Peter Pellet dismounted and unloaded their
moving picture cameras.</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Vinegar Atts boomed. “Whenever
a white man shows up at a nigger chu’ch, de niggers
lose deir religion right away. Nobody bawls ‘Amen,’
nobody whoops ‘Hallelujah,’ an’ nobody gits happy.
An’ when white mens shows up at a nigger fishin’
picnic&mdash;boof! de fun is done all over. Excusin’ dat,
dem white men ain’t real pious&mdash;dey cuss!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts beat the New Orleans lover in a
foot race to Miss Cordona’s buggy, helped her out,
and engaged her in a rapid-fire conversation while he
hitched her horse to a tree.</p>

<p>“Dem jewelry you got on yo’ pusson is shore
squinchin’ to de eyes, Laller,” he proclaimed in admiring
tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Lalla remarked with self-satisfaction,
as she preened herself before him revealing every
excruciating gaud and gewgaw she could buy from
the ten-cent store. “De man whut sold it to me told
me dat ev’y piece was <i>rolled</i> gold&mdash;he specify dat wus
de purest kind of gold whut is!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Skeeter agreed. “You’s gwine be
de only dazzle on dis fish camp&mdash;nobody cain’t shine
while you is aroun’.”</p>

<p>When Skeeter beat him to the buggy, the city beau
had simply lifted his hat to Lalla and walked away.
At that moment the automobile arrived, and the
stranger found consolation in watching the white men
and their cameras.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>Impelled by curiosity, the other negroes had gathered
around, and the new coon saw a good opportunity
to show off.</p>

<p>“Boss,” he inquired of Mr. Rouke, “is you-alls
movin’ picture mens?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is you gwine take pictures of dis here lake?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rouke replied, as he busied himself setting
up his machine.</p>

<p>The darky took off his hat, rubbed his head, hesitated
a moment, then said in a pleading voice:</p>

<p>“Please, suh, boss, would you wish to take a picture
of me doin’ some kind of stunts? I used to wuck
in de movies an’ I likes it.”</p>

<p>“Who? You?” Rouke snapped, gazing at the
negro with incredulous eyes. “What did you do in
the studio?”</p>

<p>“I wucked fer a feller whut took de pictures. He
lemme tote his extry films, and lemme hold his hat,
an’ sometimes he gimme a board wid a number on it,
an’ lemme stan’ in front of de picture-box while he
turned de crank an’ tuck my tintype.”</p>

<p>Shirley Rouke saw that this speech had made an
impression upon the negroes gathered around. He
hesitated a moment, then said:</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Dey calls me Sour Sudds.”</p>

<p>“All right, Sudds. You seem to have had considerable
experience as a movie actor. Now if you
can get some of these other people to get in it with you,
I think I will take a picture of you all.”</p>

<p>“Come on, niggers!” Sudds bellowed in delighted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
tones. “Eve’ybody is gwine hab his tintype took!
Hustle! Dese here white mens ain’t got no time fer
foolishness!”</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Sour Sudds, the picnic
party was eager to get into the picture.</p>

<p>“Is you gwine show us how to do, boss?” Sudds
inquired.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Rouke answered.</p>

<p>While Peter Pellet was adjusting his camera and
placing his side lines, Rouke went into the fishing
camp and brought out a small table and two chairs,
which he placed in front of the camera.</p>

<p>“That won’t do, Pete!” he called, pointing to
some lines which Pete had drawn in the sand. “You
better get your cord and stretch it for your side lines
like you do in the studio. These coons won’t pay
any attention to a mark on the ground!”</p>

<p>Rouke hastened to the automobile and brought
out a tray, two glasses, and a bottle of cheap wine,
while Pellet readjusted his lines.</p>

<p>Then Vinegar Atts put in.</p>

<p>“Mister Rouke, I’s gwine be de umpire of dis here
show because you an’ me done made a trade to dem
effecks.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Rouke agreed, as his eyes ran over
the crowd of negroes. “Get that black, dressy
wench sitting beside that saddle-colored man!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s Laller an’ Skeeter!” Atts informed
him.</p>

<p>“Get that black with the kinky hair and the shoebrush
mustache!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s Figger Bush!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>The three actors were conducted to the front of the
camera and Rouke gave his directions:</p>

<p>“Lalla, you and Sour Sudds sit down in the chairs
beside that little table. Sour, you make love to the
girl with all your might. Hold her hand, make goo-goo
eyes, act like you loved her more than any other
woman in the world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lemme do dat!” Skeeter Butts broke in.</p>

<p>Had there been a proneness to apoplexy in the
Rouke family, Shirley would now be dead. As it
was, Skeeter Butts never knew how near his interruption
had brought him to a sudden and violent death.
It is safe to say that nothing like that had ever happened
before in the moving picture world.</p>

<p>“Buck up, Rouke!” Pellet spoke sharply. “Don’t
scatter the beans!”</p>

<p>Rouke swallowed four times, then spoke in a voice
as gentle as the tones of a butcher conducting some
Mary’s little lamb into the slaughterhouse after the
said lamb had butted him down:</p>

<p>“No, Skeeter. I’ll tell you what to do in a minute.
I might also tell you where to go and some other
things, but duty restrains my inclination.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to Figger Bush:</p>

<p>“Now, Figger, listen: when I give the word, you
come over here and get this tray with the glasses and
the wine bottle and bring it in and set it on the table
between Lalla and Sudds. Then retire. Get me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. I fotch it in an’ git out!”</p>

<p>“Sudds, you register love, infatuation&mdash;aw, I said
that before! Lalla, you register maiden modesty,
timidity, growing love. Now, Skeeter Butts, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
I give the word you enter, walk up to the table where
Sudds and Lalla are sitting, register jealousy, anger,
desire for revenge; then catch Sour Sudds by the
shoulder, lift him out of the chair, and take the seat
yourself. Sudds, you walk off. Lalla, you look
after him and register love.”</p>

<p>The actors moved to their places and Rouke gave
the command:</p>

<p>“Now&mdash;ready&mdash;rehearse!”</p>

<p>The rehearsal was perfect. Rouke and Pellet were
delighted.</p>

<p>“Now we are ready to take the picture!” Rouke
exclaimed. “All of you act just like you did before!”</p>

<p>Then he gave the command which in the moving
picture world starts the camera crank to turning:</p>

<p>“Ready&mdash;Action&mdash;Go!”</p>

<p>Thereupon, Reverend Vinegar Atts walked out and
sat down on the table between Lalla and Sudds.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on, dar!” he bellowed, shaking his finger
at the camera. “Don’t I git my picture took, too?
You an’ me made a trade&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cut!” Rouke snapped, which is the technical
word of command to the camera artist to stop the
picture.</p>

<p>“Get away from there, you fat fool! What you
cut across the front for and spoil the picture? Get
out!”</p>

<p>Rouke’s tone and gestures were so threatening that
Vinegar jumped ten feet, tripped over a side line and
fell on his head.</p>

<p>“Aw, the devil!” Pellet snarled savagely. “Now
I got to set up that line again!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p>He stooped and clawed around on the ground to
find a rock to throw, but rocks are as scarce as ice-cream
cones in a Louisiana swamp.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Vinegar grunted as he moved farther and
farther away from the irate white men. “Dem white
gen’lemens is done poured me back in de jug!”</p>

<p>“Now, we’ll start again!” Rouke proclaimed.
“Ready, action, go!”</p>

<p>Lalla and Sour Sudds began their love play, the
camera clicking off their perfect action.</p>

<p>“Now, Figger!” Rouke bawled. “Come on!
Pick up the tray and walk to the table!”</p>

<p>Figger came on. And Rouke nearly threw a fit.</p>

<p>Seizing the tray in both hands, Figger held it in
front of him in a strained, awkward manner; he side-stepped
into the focus of the camera, set his eyes
straight at the lens where the country photographers
used to tell us the “little bird” could be seen, and
marched face-on to the table; he set the waiter down
without changing his full-face position toward the
camera, backed ten feet, side-stepped out of the focus,
then squealed and kicked up his heels much as a mule
colt would act when turned into a pasture!</p>

<p>“My&mdash;good&mdash;gosh!” Shirley Rouke shrieked.
That is to say, this is the only remark he made which
the law would permit of publication. “What did
you mean by that stunt?”</p>

<p>“I wus havin’ my picture took, boss,” Figger
informed him in frightened tones, for Figger was
appalled by the language he had heard.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;why didn’t you act natural?” Rouke
spluttered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>“Dat ain’t no way to do, boss,” Figger declared.
“When us niggers gits our tintypes koodaked us is
got to show bofe foots, bofe hands, bofe eyes, and bofe
ears. We don’t take no sideways picture. Ef us
don’t show all of ourse’ves, de niggers will figger dat
one eye done got gouged out, or one ear done been cut
off. Yes, suh, dat’s right.”</p>

<p>“Shore!” a chorus of negro voices answered. “Us
ain’t gwine hab our pictures took no way but straight
on!”</p>

<p>In hopeless impotence, Shirley Rouke turned to
Peter Pellet for aid and comfort, and beheld that
artist doubled up, helpless with laughter.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, you blue-mass pill?”
Rouke bawled.</p>

<p>“Oh, lordy, Roukey,” Peter howled. “That’s
the funniest stunt ever pulled before a camera! It’ll
get a laugh from Broadway to the Chinese Yellow
Sea. Buck up, and go on with the show!”</p>

<p>Rouke felt greatly mollified.</p>

<p>“All right! Get ready, now! Pour the wine in
those glasses, Sudds! Ready! Action! Go!”</p>

<p>The steady click of the camera amid a breathless
silence; then Rouke’s command:</p>

<p>“Come on, Skeeter! Come on!”</p>

<p>Skeeter came on!</p>

<p>He bounced into the picture with a perfect imitation
of a she-bear approaching a man who was holding
her squealing cub by the ear. Sour bad been too
realistic in his acting, and Skeeter was jealous. He
grabbed Sudds by the nose, shook him as a dog shakes
a rat, grabbed the wine bottle and broke it over Sour’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
head, then administered a punch on the jaw which
sent Sudds reeling out of his chair to the ground.</p>

<p>Then Sudds came back. Seizing Skeeter by the
nape of the neck, he pounded his head against the
table until it rattled like a snare drum. Skeeter
twisted and squealed until he managed to land a
mighty kick in the pit of Sour’s stomach, then he
sprang up, grabbed a chair and proceeded to use it as
a club.</p>

<p>Sour seized the little deal-table, poised it above his
head like a shield, and pranced around, receiving
Skeeter’s frenzied blows on the top of the table instead
of the top of his head.</p>

<p>Lalla Cordona backed slowly away from the fray,
her shapely, beautiful hands clasped over her heaving
breast, her breath coming in quick gasps, her face
expressing emotions which alternated between fear
and hope and horror and despair.</p>

<p>Then she swept forward with a grace and power
simply majestic in its action, held out her hands to the
furious men and spoke one word:</p>

<p>“Please!”</p>

<p>The negroes, whose view of the fight had been
obscured by the camera and the bodies of Rouke and
Pellet, started around them toward the front, where
they could see.</p>

<p>“Keep out of the picture!” Rouke screamed.
“I’ll kill the first nigger that moves!”</p>

<p>Skeeter and Sudds ceased their combat, dropped
their weapons of war, and each held out his hands
to Lalla Cordona, pleading, beseeching, each asking
her approval of the part he had taken in the fray.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>The girl stood for a moment looking from one to the
other, hesitant, indignant.</p>

<p>“Don’t pay no mind to dat Sudds, Missy,”
Skeeter pleaded. “His name proves dat he ain’t
nothin’ but dirty dishwater, an’ his maw wus a cheap
washlady. Come along wid me, an’ be my frien’! I
loves you mo’ dan he do!”</p>

<p>“You niggers hike!” Lalla spoke.</p>

<p>Her voice bit into their souls like acid, and the
men turned and started slowly away.</p>

<p>The girl stood looking after them a moment, then she
ran to the tree where her horse was standing hitched.</p>

<p>Skeeter and Sudds sprang after her.</p>

<p>“Come back, Miss Laller!” they bawled in a duet.
“Us’ll be real nice gen’lemens!”</p>

<p>“No!” she said sharply, as she untied her horse
and sprang into the buggy. “I done had enough
rough-housin’ to last me a long time. I’s gwine back
to Tickfall!”</p>

<p>Drenched with perspiration, his face as red as
blood, Shirley Rouke mopped the sweat from his
forehead and gazed inquiringly at Peter Pellet.</p>

<p>Peter was panting like a hot dog, but his eyes
blazed in triumph.</p>

<p>“I got it all, Roukey!” he said.</p>


<h3>V<br />

READY&mdash;ACTION&mdash;GO!</h3>

<p>Shirley Rouke and Peter Pellet sat upon the sun-slashed
porch of the Tickfall hotel smoking their
after-breakfast cigars.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>The day was as clear and beautiful and buoyant
as a soap bubble, and the Gulf breeze, sweeping
across one hundred miles of forest, tasted salt upon
their lips, and made music upon the fluted tree tops.</p>

<p>Rev. Vinegar Atts and Sour Sudds ploughed across
the sandy street, and stepped upon the porch, where
the men reclined in their chairs in lazy enjoyment of
the hour.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rouke,” Vinegar began, “when is us gwine
start takin’ our koodaks?”</p>

<p>“You niggers ain’t got good sense,” Rouke replied
indifferently. “I tried to take the pictures yesterday,
and you coons rough-housed and made a pack of
dang monkeys out of yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s so,” Vinegar acquiesced. “But
I done de best I could. Dem niggers ain’t edgecated
up to koodaks yit.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” Shirley drawled.</p>

<p>“Me an’ Brudder Sudds is been talkin’ about it,”
Vinegar went on, “an’ Sudds specify dat he don’t
think he had a fair show. He wants to hab one mo’
try-on.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” Sudds chimed in.</p>

<p>“What do you folks want to do?” Shirley asked
curiously.</p>

<p>“Sudds, he specify dat he figgers dat a make-b’lieve
weddin’ betwix’ him an’ dat N’Awleens gal
would be jes’ de right do,” Vinegar proposed.</p>

<p>“Who’ll marry ’em?” Rouke asked, watching the
smoke curl up from the end of his cigar.</p>

<p>“Me!” Vinegar proclaimed in an explosive tone.
“Dat is my real bizzness. I marrifies all de niggers.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p>“I see,” Shirley grinned. “You want to get into
the picture yourself!”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, I’ll take a real good picture. I ain’t
got no whiskers an’ my head is bald&mdash;dar ain’t nothin’
to hide me.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Rouke laughed. “Get all the niggers
together, and I’ll try it again. Maybe you folks will
get used to the camera after a while, and I can put
on my play. Where is that little wench named
Lulu&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Laller?” Vinegar corrected him. “She wucks fer
Sheriff John Flournoy. I’ll git her for you.”</p>

<p>“Get busy, then,” Rouke snapped, his mind beginning
to work like a dynamo. “Get all the niggers
together at the Shoofly church at twelve o’clock.
Tell that Lulu&mdash;Laller, to dress herself up for a wedding.
Hunt up that Skoot Butts, and tell him to get
ready to act the part of the rejected suitor&mdash;he was
certainly a dandy in that rôle yesterday! Hunt up
that Diamond Hitch, and tell him he is to be the
father of Lalla, and give her away at the wedding.
That’s all!”</p>

<p>Vinegar knew that he was dismissed, but he still
lingered.</p>

<p>“Well?” Rouke demanded sharply, “what’s blocking
the wheels of progress now?”</p>

<p>“Boss,” Vinegar said bashfully “you an’ me made
a trade&mdash;an’ I’s wucked powerful hard&mdash;an’ ’pears
to me like a few loose money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Rouke said, reaching into his pocket. “I
presume you and Sudds have earned five dollars
each, but danged if I know what you did for it!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>The two delighted darkies snatched the money,
crammed it into their pockets, and went stamping
down the steps.</p>

<p>At the corner, Sour Sudds said:</p>

<p>“Elder, you go hunt up dem niggers Mr. Rouke
tole you ’bout, an’ I’ll rack over to de cotehouse an’
git dem license!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Vinegar boomed. “Dat white
man done plum’ fergot dem cotehouse papers, an’ dis
is gwine be a real cotehouse wedding. I fetches ’em
off fine, Sudds. You oughter see me git active in a
mattermony pufformunce!”</p>

<p>The negroes separated, and three hours later,
the wedding party had assembled at the Shoofly
church, and Rouke and Pellet arrived, each with a
camera.</p>

<p>Peter Pellet got his location, adjusted his machine
fixed his side lines and announced himself in readiness.</p>

<p>Rouke studied his characters, then began his
instructions:</p>

<p>“Elder Atts, you and Sour Sudds are to come into
the picture together and await the arrival of the bride.
Lalla Cordona comes in on the arm of Diamond Hitch.
All the rest of you folks bunch up together behind the
wedding party. Skeeter Butts, you establish yourself&mdash;stand
out in front of the invited guests, and
register pain because you have lost this beautiful
bride. Now&mdash;ready&mdash;rehearse!”</p>

<p>Then Sour Sudds suddenly bethought himself,
fumbled in his pocket, trotted into the church and
came out with a little square-topped writing table
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
and a chair, and placed them in full view of the
camera.</p>

<p>“What the devil&mdash;” Rouke began to splutter like
the fuse of a cannon-cracker about to explode.</p>

<p>“Dis here table is fer de witnesses to sign de license,
boss,” Sudds explained, as he drew a paper out of his
pocket, spread it out, and then from the same capacious
pocket brought forth a pen and a bottle of ink.
“Sheriff John Flournoy gimme dis paper an’ I come
mighty nigh fergettin’ it! He didn’t charge me
nothin’ fer dis license, neither.”</p>

<p>“I see!” Rouke exclaimed. “Set that table back
a little&mdash;that’s it! Now you wedding guests come in
and stand behind that table&mdash;that’s right! Now
ready&mdash;rehearse!”</p>

<p>The rehearsal was perfect.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” Rouke exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, ’tain’t!” Sour Sudds growled. “Don’t
de preacher be allowed to say no words?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Rouke told him, “but it is not necessary
in a rehearsal!”</p>

<p>“Now, I tells you dis:” Sour Sudds responded in
belligerent tones, “when de picture is took ef Elder
Atts ain’t ’lowed to say all de words jes’ like dis wus a
real weddin’, I ain’t gwine hab nothin’ to do wid it!”</p>

<p>“He’ll say ’em all right, Sour,” Rouke assured
him. “Keep your shirt on&mdash;don’t disarrange your
linen! Now we’re ready for the picture! Vinegar,
you marry these people just like you would in a
church at a sure-enough wedding. Ready&mdash;action&mdash;go!”</p>

<p>Sour Sudds laid his hand upon the elbow of Reverend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Vinegar Atts and the two marched into the
picture. Sudds was trembling all over and his lips
twitched with nervousness so great that he constantly
strove to wipe the emotion away by scraping the back
of his hand across his mouth.</p>

<p>The wedding guests moved into the picture, taking
their locations behind the little writing table, and
Skeeter Butts established himself in full view, his
battered, swollen face&mdash;a result of the fracas at the
fishing camp the day before&mdash;successfully “registering”
all the emotions of pain, chagrin, anger, and
sorrow at his loss of the beautiful bride.</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond came into the picture with the
bride on his arm&mdash;or rather, by the arm. Hitch was
regal in his walk and manner, and his widespread,
grinning mouth demonstrated beyond a doubt that
he was delighted to give the bride away; while Lalla
Cordona, shy, drooping, taking embarrassed glances
from side to side, sometimes giving vent to an insane
snicker, was a perfect imitation of the real thing in
dusky brides.</p>

<p>She wore the proverbial bridal veil, wore it loosely,
sloppily, resembling a wet dishrag thrown over the
top of a post. Her bridal dress was popped open in
the back where the buttons had burst, the lace at the
bottom of her skirt had been torn by her walk to the
church through the weeds.</p>

<p>That dress had evidently been, at one time, some
young lady’s evening gown, and the glossy black of
Lalla’s bare shoulders and arms in the glare of the
noonday sun was not only startling&mdash;it was shocking.
Short white kid gloves covered the damsel’s hands,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
which she kept folded in maidenly modesty across her
breast.</p>

<p>Hitch held her by the arm with the air of a policeman
conducting a prisoner to the lock-up, and when
he surrendered her to Sour Sudds, Sour grabbed her
elbow in the same official and authoritative manner.</p>

<p>“Dear-ly be-lub-bed!” Vinegar Atts bawled in a
voice which could be heard a mile, and whining his
words with a peculiar, sing-song intonation which no
other people on earth can imitate:</p>

<p>“Dear-ly be-lub-bed, we am gathered togedder in
de sight of Gawd an’ de ’socheation of dese witness
to hitch togedder dis here man an’ dis here woman in
de holy bonduce of mattermony, which am a powerful
good thing but ain’t by nobody to be tuck up wid
sudden-like, but atter prayerful study on de wharfore
an’ de outcome. Ef ary one of you niggers knows a
good cause why not dey should be married, bawl out
right now, or forever&mdash;hol’&mdash;yo’&mdash;peace!”</p>

<p>Skeeter Butts moved uneasily, opened his mouth
to speak, then muttered in a low tone:</p>

<p>“I s’pose dis is all a play-like, but it shore looks
nachelly like de plum’ real thing to me!”</p>

<p>After an impressive pause, Vinegar continued,
addressing his remarks to the principals:</p>

<p>“Ef ary one of you two niggers knows any jus’ an’
lawful an’ resomble cause whyfo’ you shouldn’t git
married bawl it out right now, or else forever&mdash;hereinafter&mdash;hencefo’th&mdash;hol’&mdash;yo’&mdash;peace!”</p>

<p>No impediment being alleged, Vinegar Atts glared
at Sour Sudds and howled:</p>

<p>“Sour, is you gwine take dis woman to be yo’ reg’lar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
cotehouse wife; is you gwine buy her vittles, chop
her stove wood, pack her water, tote her washings to
an’ fro from de white folks’ house, an’ excusin’ all
yuther female womans, hang only onto her, so long
as you bofe lives, so&mdash;he’p&mdash;you&mdash;Gawd, hope you
may die?”</p>

<p>“I is!” Sour Sudds replied.</p>

<p>“Laller, is you gwine take dis man to be you’ reg’lar
cotehouse husbunt; is you gwine cook his grub,
patch his britches, clean up atter him, keep him in
chawin’ terbaccer, an’ excusin’ all yuther men’s take
in washin’ only fer him, an’ stick only to him so long
as you bofe lives togedder, so&mdash;he’p&mdash;you&mdash;Gawd?”</p>

<p>“I’m are!” Lalla snickered.</p>

<p>“J’ine yo’ right hands!” Vinegar bellowed. “Let
us pray!”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, then, in a tone
which throbbed with indignation and rebuke, Atts
said to Sour and Lalla:</p>

<p>“You two niggers shet yo’ eyes! You got to shet
yo’ eyes to pray!”</p>

<p>“De Good Book say, ‘Watch an’ pray,’” Sour
protested.</p>

<p>Vinegar glowered at them until they shut their
eyes; having satisfied himself that they would observe
the proprieties during his petition, he howled:</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawdymussy! Pity dese here two people
whut is done united deir lives an’ deir forchines.
Don’t let ’em got no deevo’ce, even if dey wants it
<i>bad</i>! An’ I shore hopes dar won’t be no quollin’ or
fussin’ or fightin’. Amen!”</p>

<p>“O Lord!” Peter Pellet whispered in imitation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Vinegar, as he slowly turned the crank of the camera.
He spoke only loud enough for Rouke to hear: “O
Lord, deliver me henceforth and forever from such a
film hog as this big fat slob of a preacher!”</p>

<p>“March over an’ sign de obscribe!” Vinegar Atts
bellowed, waving his hand toward the little writing
table. “Yes make yo’ mark, niggers! I’ll tell de
clerk whose marks dey am, an’ he’ll write down de
names!”</p>

<p>When the last scribe had straightened up from the
table and laid down the pen Sour Sudds snatched up
the license, walked over and waved it in the face of
Lalla Cordona, and in a voice which rang with triumph
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Now, you slick little nigger gal! I fit an’ bled
an’ died fer you at de fish camp yistiddy, an’ you
throwed me down flat&mdash;but I got you jes’ de same!
Dis paper is a real, reg’lar license from de cotehouse,
Vinegar Atts is done said de words, de obscribe is
done been signed, an’ dat picture man is got a tintype
of de whole weddin’! I got you! You is my
lawful cotehouse wife!”</p>

<p>With a low, gurgling cry which ended in a scream,
Lalla Cordona staggered backward, tottered as if
about to fall, stumbled with pain-stricken face toward
the two men standing by the clicking camera,
then covered her face with her hands and sank, sobbing,
to the ground.</p>

<p>There was a moment of intense silence while the
surprising trick sank into the dull minds of the negroes.</p>

<p>Then Skeeter Butts screamed like a maniac and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
hurled himself at Sour Sudds. The two men went
down under the mighty impact, and Sour dropped the
license from his hand. When they arose, Sour was
struggling for his life to wrest an automatic pistol
from the hands of Skeeter, while the little barkeeper,
absolutely insane with fury, was fighting murderously
to free the weapon and to kill.</p>

<p>In the midst of the struggle the hand of one of the
fighters touched the trigger while the weapon was
poised in the air. There were ten shots and the
dangerous gun was empty!</p>

<p>Screaming with baffled rage, Skeeter gouged and
fought and bit, but Sour was cooler and stronger, and
slowly forced Skeeter back, until he had him pressed
against the little writing table. In a moment Skeeter’s
back would have been broken.</p>

<p>“Hey, dar!” Hitch Diamond bawled. “Let dat
little coon alone!”</p>

<p>The whole mass of negroes made a forward movement
toward Sudds, and the darky saw that they
would tear him to pieces. Releasing Skeeter, he
jumped to one side, sought for some place of flight,
then ran into the Shoofly church.</p>

<p>With a howl like a wolf-pack the mob rushed into
the church after him.</p>

<p>Shirley Rouke seized his extra camera, ran behind
the church and set it in position just as the mob came
pouring out of the rear door.</p>

<p>Sour was aiming for the deep woods in the rear of
the church, but as he started for them he confronted
Skeeter with his automatic pistol. Sour had no means
of knowing whether Skeeter had reloaded his gun, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
he ducked and started at full speed around the church
with the mob in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>He dived into the church through the front door
again, leaped out of a side window and started for the
woods. But the mob split into two parts in the
church, some of them going out of the rear door and
some out of the front, and they met half-way around
the Shoofly church with Sour Sudds in the middle.</p>

<p>Struggling, panting, fighting, finally screaming for
help, Sour plunged and kicked and bit and scratched,
working his way around to the front of the church
again.</p>

<p>And there stood Lalla Cordona, her shapely hands
clutched across her heaving bosom, watching the
fray.</p>

<p>“He’p, Laller, fer Gawd’s sake! Dey’ll kill me!”
Sour shrieked, with arms outstretched toward her.</p>

<p>It was his last word.</p>

<p>He went down in the whirlpool of spinning arms
and legs while the mob snarled like wild hogs and tore
at his prostrate body.</p>

<p>The sight sickened the girl and she turned away
with face agonized, horror-stricken. Then the
wretched negro’s prayerful plea for help galvanized
her into action.</p>

<p>By the side of the church there was a piece of
scantling about the size and length of a baseball bat.
Lalla picked it up and waded into that mob like an
Amazon.</p>

<p>Biff! the scantling struck a head and the owner of
the head ceased operations and sank heavily to the
ground. Biff! Biff! Biff! Like Father Time with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
scythe, Lalla mowed the men down, or made such a
deep impression on their minds that they were glad
to retire.</p>

<p>At last she worked her way down to where poor
Sour Sudds lay. But he did not lie there very long.
Recalling his duplicity and deceit with reference to
the marriage ceremony, and appalled at the dexterity
with which Lalla handled her club, he rose from
that spot, broke the world record for a hundred yard
dash, and disappeared in the woods, still running.</p>

<p>Tickfall saw him no more.</p>

<p>Lalla turned, walked across the grass to where the
marriage license lay upon the ground and picked it up.</p>

<p>She glanced at it, laughed, then carried it up close
to the camera and held it so Rouke and Pellet could
see it, and the all-seeing eye of the clicking machine
might record it on the film.</p>

<p>It was a legal document issued by the City of New
Orleans, Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana.</p>

<p>It was signed and sealed by John Flournoy, Sheriff
of Tickfall Parish, and an incorrigible practical joker.</p>

<p>It was a Dog License!</p>


<h3>VI<br />

“CUT!”</h3>

<p>Three days later, Peter Pellet entered the Tickfall
bank and found Colonel Tom Gaitskill and Sheriff
John Flournoy sitting beside a desk smoking and
chatting.</p>

<p>“Good!” Peter exclaimed. “I am sent to find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
both of you gentlemen. Mr. Shirley Rouke invites
you down to the theater to watch a try-out of our
new picture. It’s local stuff, you know, and he
wants home criticism.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come!” Gaitskill exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sitting within the little theater, the two men
witnessed upon the screen one of the rarest exhibitions
in the world of the skill and ingenuity of a
motion picture director and producer&mdash;an exhibition
which caused the Gitagraft Company to make an
amazing increase in Shirley Rouke’s salary and
which caused the world to add an astounding laudation
to his already great fame as an artist.</p>

<p>The picture was perfect in plot and execution, full
of love, fighting, tragedy, humor, and the two great
scenes were the episodes we have described at the
fish camp and the wedding at the Shoofly church.</p>

<p>Through the picture there ran rare scenes of the
Louisiana jungle with the bear and deer in their native
haunts, the wild hogs of the Gaitskill hog-camp, the
deep, still forests with their wide, cool lanes, the sluggish
bayous winding amid rank vegetation.</p>

<p>Two characters moved through the story, holding
the thread of the plot&mdash;Lalla Cordona and Sour
Sudds, and their acting was perfect.</p>

<p>When the picture ended, the men were voluble in
their expressions of approbation.</p>

<p>Mr. Shirley Rouke walked over and shook hands
with Colonel Tom Gaitskill.</p>

<p>“Colonel,” he said earnestly, “if it had not been
for your help I could never have gotten that picture.
I thank you ten thousand times. Your suggestion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
that I take the picture without the negroes knowing
it by having some one in the know to lead ’em in
their stunts was the real, right dope! By George!
Pete and I stalked those darkies through the swamp
just like we stalked the wild animals in the African
jungle. We followed them everywhere!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know one of those niggers in the picture,”
Sheriff Flournoy said. “Who is the bridegroom
in the fake wedding?”</p>

<p>“He’s the only good negro movie actor in the
world!” Rouke informed him. “We employ him in
our studio in New Orleans. He’s gone back home
now.”</p>

<p>“What bothers me,” Gaitskill said, “is that bride
in the wedding ceremony, who takes the lead in the
whole picture. That woman is not a nigger!”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I guess not</i>!” Rouke exclaimed. “She’s
a Spanish Moor. She’s the highest salaried movie
actress in the Gitagraft Company and has acted in
our pictures all around the world. In the North she
was an Esquimau, in Montana she was an Indian
princess, in Tokio she was a Geisha girl, in Hong-kong
she was the emperor’s daughter, and in our South
Sea Island picture she took a seventy-foot dive off of a
mountain crag into the ocean. She can speak every
language on earth, or if she can’t she can fake it until
a native would not know the diff&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>This dissertation was suddenly interrupted by a
rich, sweet-toned, dramatic voice, speaking the
technical word which in the moving picture world
instructs the camera artist to stop action:</p>

<p>“Cut!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>The man whirled around and looked into the smiling
face of Lalla Cordona.</p>

<p>She had slipped into the theater unobserved to
witness the first try-out of the new picture.</p>

<p>She arose from her seat and advanced toward the
men with all the grace and beauty of the Arabian
princess that she was, garbed gloriously in the latest
creations of Fifth Avenue modistes and milliners, a
thing of dainty, exquisite, infatuating beauty and
loveliness whose dark skin was as fine as spun silk,
as delicate as cobweb, as glowing as polished ebony,
and whose whole body flamed with the soul, the
magnetism, the life of her.</p>

<p>As Rouke spoke her name introducing Colonel
Gaitskill, she said:</p>

<p>“I beg everybody’s pardon for my rude interruption.
But it’s deadly boresome to hear your own
funeral encomium, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“I judge from the general tenor of Mr. Rouke’s
remarks that anything you do is perfectly all right,”
Gaitskill laughed. Then he asked: “Where have you
been stopping while in Tickfall, Miss Cordona?”</p>

<p>“I suppose the sheriff will put me under arrest,”
she answered with a throaty, chuckling laugh, “but I
have been a cook in Mr. Flournoy’s home in the last
five days. In the South a black face indicates a
nigger, and I knew that my only door of entrance to a
white man’s home was through the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord,” Flournoy mourned, “I’ve lost the
best cook in the whole world! Tom, I was going to
invite you out for a meal to show her off&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the voice of a man sobbing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
The cry seemed to rack and tear the throat as if Pain
had picked up the heart in red hot pincers holding
the quivering flesh until it dropped the thick, black
blood of agony.</p>

<p>They turned and saw Skeeter Butts slip out of the
door of the little theater.</p>

<p>He had followed Lalla Cordona down the street,
had entered the little theater unobserved, and had
heard enough to know that all the blossoms of love
in his heart had fruited into Dead Sea apples filled
with ash and soot.</p>

<p>“Gawd!” he sighed pitifully, as he dragged his
leaden feet toward the Hen-Scratch saloon, “I wish
I wus a white man ’stead of a coon!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="DD">D.D.</h2>


<p>“It cain’t be did, niggers,” Skeeter Butts announced
in a tone of finality, as he lighted a new
cigarette on the stub of the old one. “Dis here
chu’ch is a busted onfinancial institootion.”</p>

<p>He leaned his hide-bottomed chair against the
trunk of the chinaberry tree in the churchyard, tipped
his derby hat forward until the brim was level with
his eyes, and surveyed with disgust that dilapidated
structure known as the Shoofly church.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t cost much,” the Rev. Vinegar Atts
protested earnestly. “Dis chu’ch is been needin’
dem improvements fer a long time.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so,” Hitch Diamond growled. “You
don’t need no ’lectric readin’ lamp to sot on yo’
pulpit. You kin read by de light over yo’ head.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t needin’ no fancy pulpit chair to sot on,
either,” Skeeter Butts remarked.</p>

<p>“De springs is all busted outen de bottom of de
one I’m got,” Vinegar complained. “When I sot
down I feels like I’m settin’ in a bushel basket. My
stomick is over on my knees an’ my foots is mighty
nigh up to my chin. De price ain’t so powerful high&mdash;twenty
dollars fer de settee an’ five fer de readin’
lamp. Dat don’t seem much to me.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

<p>“Us’ll git you dem fancy decoorshuns fer Christmus,
Brudder Atts,” Skeeter smiled. “Dis here is
August&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and peered down the road
with great interest. A slim, black negro, dressy and
citified, was picking his way along the dusty road
toward the Shoofly church.</p>

<p>The three men adjusted their chairs so they could
watch him as he came up the little hill. They noticed
that he gazed down at the deep sand through gold-rimmed
spectacles, that he picked places in the road
which would not bury his shiny patent-leather shoes,
that he exercised great care to protect his linen suit
from flying particles of dust, and he carried a near-gold
wrist-watch which he consulted frequently, as if
he were bound to get up that hill on schedule time.</p>

<p>“I knows him,” Skeeter Butts whispered. “I
met his ’quaintance at de deppo dis mawnin’. He
blowed in wid a long-whisker white man whut is
visitin’ de Revun Sentelle. Dis here new coon is
callin’ hisse’f Green Trapps.”</p>

<p>Green sighed with relief when he reached the gate
of the churchyard, and came across the lawn toward
the three men with an ingratiating grin. Vinegar
Atts kicked the chair on which his feet were resting
toward the newcomer as an invitation to be seated.</p>

<p>“Mawnin’, Greenie,” Skeeter Butts greeted.
“Us is been expectin’ you to look up some of yo’ own
kin an’ color.”</p>

<p>He introduced Green to Vinegar and Hitch, passed
him the cigarettes, and then waited for Green to open
the conversation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span></p>

<p>“You niggers ain’t pregaged in no bizziness discussion,
I hopes,” Green remarked. “I don’t hanker
to butt in.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no secret bizzness,” Skeeter replied.
“Dis here Revun Atts craves a readin’ lamp an’ a
pulpit chair fer his chu’ch, an’ us members don’t
aspire to git him none.”</p>

<p>Thereupon for the enlightenment of Green Trapps,
the three men repeated all the conversation and arguments
which had occupied them for an hour before
Green arrived. At the conclusion of the talk-fest,
Skeeter Butts demanded:</p>

<p>“What does you think about it, Greenie?”</p>

<p>“I agrees wid you-all,” Green said promptly.
“Vinegar needs dem great improvements, an’ de
Shoofly cain’t affode to git ’em. Therefo’ you-all
oughter turn yo’ minds to somepin mo’ important.”</p>

<p>He took off his gold spectacles, polished them carefully
with a big silk handkerchief, then rubbed the
shining face of his wrist-watch and finally flicked the
corner of his handkerchief over his shiny shoes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ more important,” Vinegar
Atts grumbled in manifest disappointment.</p>

<p>“As de revun pastor of de Shoofly is you got a
D.D. degree?” Green asked blandly.</p>

<p>“Got a&mdash;which?” Vinegar asked, showing the
whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Is you ever took on a kawlidge-gate degree?”
Green repeated.</p>

<p>“I done tuck ten degrees in de Nights of Darkness
Lodge,” Vinegar replied. “I don’t need no mo’.
De las’ one I tuck dey made me ballunce a raw egg
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
on my bald head an’ a nigger hit it wid a paddle&mdash;ruint
all my nice lodge clothes.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shuckins! I don’t mean dat,” Green snorted
in disgust. “Ain’t you no Doctor of Dervinity?
Don’t de white folks call you de Revun Dr. Vinegar
Atts? Ain’t you no scholard like de Revun Dr.
Sentelle an’ dem yuther white preachers?”</p>

<p>“Naw, suh,” Vinegar said regretfully. “Dis here
pig ain’t got no curl to his tail like you mentions.”</p>

<p>“You had oughter git you a D.D.,” Green said
with conviction.</p>

<p>“De Elder needs a couple of D’s,” Hitch Diamond
rumbled, delighted with the idea.</p>

<p>“De Revun Dr. Vinegar Atts, D.D. of Dervinity,
pasture of de Shoofly Mefdis Chu’ch, Tickfall, Loozanny,”
Skeeter Butts vocalized, mouthing the words
pompously. “Gosh! I’d gib a dollar to see de Elder
dolled up like dat!”</p>

<p>“It’ll cost fifty dollars,” Green said quietly, looking
at his wrist-watch as if he feared to miss an engagement.
“I kin git one fer you fer dat many money.”</p>

<p>Vinegar’s face was glowing like a saint who had
seen a heavenly vision.</p>

<p>“How come you is peddlin’ dem D.D.’s aroun’?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I travels wid de Revun Dr. Gilbo, pres’dent of
de Silliway Female Institoot,” Green said easily.
“Us come to town dis mawnin’ to intervoo some rich
folks in dis town. Us don’t never run atter nobody’s
money, but we makes it a p’int to go whar money is
at, an’ we is powerful kind an’ high perlite to de fellers
whut is got money.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Vinegar applauded.</p>

<p>“Now dis here Dr. Gilbo, he told me ef I could sell
a couple of D.D.’s on dis trip to a couple deservin’
nigger peachers, he wouldn’t hab no objections. I
got de papers wid me now.”</p>

<p>He reached into his breast pocket and brought
forth a crackling sheet of parchment. The three
Tickfall negroes had never seen a college diploma.
Had they been able to read this one they might have
been enlightened; but unfortunately for them it was
written in Latin. Its mystery conferred upon it a
vast importance.</p>

<p>Green Trapps indicated a blank space with his
finger.</p>

<p>“All I’m got to do is to write yo’ name right dar,
Revun,” he said. “Atter dat I collecks my money,
passes dis here obscribe over to you, an’ de D.D. is
did.”</p>

<p>“Sounds easy,” Vinegar said, his face aglow.</p>

<p>“Of co’se, niggers, dis here is white folks’ bizzness
an’ us is got to speak it easy,” Green said as he rolled
his parchment and replaced it in his coat pocket.
“Dar ain’t many white kawlidges in dis worl’ whut
D.D.’s niggers.”</p>

<p>He looked at his wrist-watch and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“De Revun Dr. Gilbo takes two pills an’ a charcoal
tablet at ’leben o’clock, niggers,” he announced. “I
got to go wait on him.”</p>

<p>“Hol’ on, Greenie,” Hitch Diamond rumbled.
“Ef we wus ter be of a mind to bestow a D.D. on
Vinegar, how soon could us git de goods?”</p>

<p>“Colleck yo’ money up by to-night, an’ us will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
bestow de paper befo’ de Shoofly cong’gation tomorrer
night,” Green suggested as he turned and
walked away from the conference.</p>

<p>When Green had gone the three sat for a long time
in perfect silence. Vinegar was longing and hoping
for that little scrap of parchment, wondering how he
could attain it. Skeeter was wishing in an indifferent
way that Vinegar had an honorary degree, but he
was determining in his own mind that he would purchase
a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles just like
Green’s. At last Hitch Diamond spoke:</p>

<p>“Listen to dis idear, niggers: de Nights of Darkness
Lodge meets to-night. I favors axin’ all de
members of de lodge to cont’ibute a few change to
make up de fifty dollars an’ buy Vinegar Atts a couple
of D’s.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de trick, Hitchie,” Skeeter shouted. “Of
co’se, de lodge is secret work an’ de white folks won’t
know nothin’ about it. Dat comes up to de rules dat
Green laid down.”</p>

<p>“I think dat’s a good notion,” Hitch mumbled.</p>

<p>“I favors it,” Skeeter agreed.</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Vinegar Atts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The session of the Nights of Darkness Lodge proceeded
quietly until the question was asked: “Is
there any new business?”</p>

<p>Thereupon Hitch Diamond, the grand exalted ruler,
rose to his feet, cleared his throat, and spoke:</p>

<p>“Brudders, us cullud folks of Tickfall an’ especial
de members of dis lodge b’lieves in showin’ high an’
exalted salutes to people whut deserves it. I rises to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
pernounce dat de time is now come to show a pertickler
favor to our feller brudder member, Revun
Vinegar Atts.”</p>

<p>Vinegar arose, bowed, and sat down.</p>

<p>“De high exalted chaplain of dis lodge ain’t as
high as he might git, an’ I aims to ax you-alls to put
him whar he b’longs. We wants a preacher we kin
be proud of, an’ Vinegar Atts needs a couple of D.’s
to finish him off complete. I moves dat we chip in
an’ buy ’em fer him.”</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh,” Vinegar arose and said, and sat
down.</p>

<p>Hitch’s speech was not as enlightening as it should
have been, and it was met with complete silence.
Each member was trying to think out what Hitch
meant. After a while Skeeter Butts remarked:</p>

<p>“I favors buyin’ a D.D. fer Vinegar, an’ I now
cont’ibutes one dollars to dat puppus.”</p>

<p>Skeeter walked over to the altar in the middle of
the lodge floor and dropped a resounding dollar upon
the top. The negroes looked at the dollar with great
curiosity, but they needed more light before they
were willing to add any money to that contribution.
After another silence, Figger Bush asked:</p>

<p>“Whut is dat one silver dollar fer, Skeeter?”</p>

<p>“To he’p buy a D.D.,” Skeeter informed him.</p>

<p>“Whut am a D.D.?” Bush inquired.</p>

<p>“It’s a&mdash;a&mdash;a kawlidge piece of paper wid writin’
on it,” Skeeter explained lamely.</p>

<p>“How much do she cost?” Bush persisted.</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars,” Skeeter told him.</p>

<p>A murmur of protest ran around the room. No
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
one had the remotest idea what Skeeter was talking
about, but they could all grasp the significance of
fifty dollars. It was apparent that they would not
favor buying anything for Vinegar Atts which cost
that much money.</p>

<p>“I don’t ketch on to dis here foolishness,” Figger
complained. “I don’t gib none of my money fer
somepin I ain’t understood in my mind. I motions
dat Vinegar Atts git up an’ tell us whut he wants us
to git him.”</p>

<p>“Dar is a white man in town whut wants to make
me a preachin’ doctor,” Vinegar explained. “De
license cost fifty dollars an’ some of my frien’s an’
lodge brudders wants me to git it.”</p>

<p>“Whut does you aim to doctor&mdash;hosses?” Figger
asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, ’tain’t no medicine doctor; it’s a
preachin’ doctor I wants to be, like Dr. Sentelle.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Figger grunted and sank down into his
seat. The mystery was too great for his feeble
mind.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a loud knocking at the
door. Then the outer guard reported:</p>

<p>“A stranger is outside&mdash;he ain’t got no grip or
password&mdash;wants to git inside.”</p>

<p>“Whut mought his name be?” Hitch inquired.</p>

<p>“Green Trapps.”</p>

<p>Hitch received this announcement with joy, for
now he had some one who could explain the mystery.</p>

<p>“De lodge will be at rest,” he announced. “Outer
guard, admit Perfessor Green Trapps.”</p>

<p>The lodge stood up and viewed this citified negro
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
as he walked slowly up the hall under the escort of
the guard. His appearance was pleasing, and they
gave him the lodge salute when he was introduced,
and sat down to look at him some more.</p>

<p>“You is come jes’ in time, Perfessor,” Hitch Diamond
bellowed. “Us is got our D.D. program in a
jam, an’ we wants you to tell it to us agin, so our
minds kin git clear.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t hard to understan’, brudders,” Green
Trapps began, as he surveyed the assembly through
his gold-rimmed spectacles, and smiled at them
benevolently. “De Silliway Female Institoot is got
two hon’able degrees to bestow on two deservin’
preachers of de cullud race, an’ de Revun Vinegar
Atts is ’lected to git one. De female institoot will
make him a doctor fer fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want Vinegar made no female doctor!”
Figger Bush squeaked.</p>

<p>“We don’t make him no female doctor,” Green
explained patiently. “We makes him a D.D.&mdash;a
Doctor of Dervinity.”</p>

<p>“Is you one of dem things you mentions?” Pap
Curtain, a tall, yellow negro, asked in a snarling voice.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, I ain’t no preacher. I’s wid a kawlidge.
Therefo’ I’s a D.V.”</p>

<p>“Is dar any more D.D.’s in dis town?” Pap
asked.</p>

<p>“Dar ain’t but one an’ he’s white,” Green replied.
“His name is Revun Dr. Sentelle, D.D.”</p>

<p>“Dar now!” Pap Curtain exclaimed exultantly.
“I think I ketch on. Dis here female kawlidge
wants to fix Vinegar up like Revun Sentelle&mdash;make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
him sound dis way: De Revun Dr. Vinegar Atts,
D.D. Is dat de notion?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” Green grinned. “Dat’s a bird’s-eye
view!”</p>

<p>Pap ran his hand into his capacious pocket and
brought forth a silver dollar. He dropped it with a
loud thump beside Skeeter’s money on the altar.</p>

<p>“I favors it, nigger. Less gib Vinegar all de
frills!”</p>

<p>Hitch Diamond hastened to contribute his dollar,
and Vinegar Atts followed him with two dollars.</p>

<p>“I’s willing’ to pay mo’ dan anybody fer whut I
gits fer myse’f,” he announced happily.</p>

<p>Figger Bush walked forward and laid down fifty
cents.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no scholard, brudders,” he said apologetically.
“I don’t see more’n four bits wuth of good
dat I’ll git outen dem D’s.”</p>

<p>One by one the members of the lodge advanced
and contributed their bit to this honorary degree to
be bestowed upon their chaplain. But silver dollars
were scarce in the crowd, and fifty-cent pieces were
soon exhausted and two-bit contributions were scanty
and then dimes and nickels made up the rest of the
pile.</p>

<p>“Ef eve’ybody is done his do, de inner guard will
please count de remains,” Hitch announced.</p>

<p>Figger Bush advanced and separated the silver in
neat little piles. A minute later he announced the
result:</p>

<p>“Twenty-five dollars!”</p>

<p>The lodge received this statement in gloomy silence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Green Trapps sat down, took the college
diploma out of his pocket and unrolled it. The
sight of that precious document almost brought the
tears to Vinegar’s eyes.</p>

<p>It was a long time before a suggestion was offered,
but finally Pap Curtain spoke:</p>

<p>“Brudders, I’s powerful sorry dat we couldn’t make
de riffle an’ fix Vinegar up right. But dese here is
hard times fer niggers an’ cash money is scarce. But
I rejoices dat we is raised as much as we has. Now I
makes dis motion: Vinegar is been bawlin’ fer a
readin’ lamp an’ a pulpit settee fer a long time.
Less take dis cash money an’ ease down Vinegar’s
feelin’s a little by buyin’ him de lamp an’ de settee.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de notion,” a chorus of voices answered.</p>

<p>But Green Trapps, D.V., saw no reason why that
money should be diverted from its original purpose.
He sprang to his feet, waving the college diploma.</p>

<p>“I got a better notion dan dat, brudders,” he
exclaimed earnestly. “I figgers dat Vinegar wants
dis here degree. Ain’t dat so, Revun?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” Vinegar murmured.</p>

<p>“Ef dat’s de case, I makes you-all dis bizziness
trade: de price of a D.D. is fifty dollars. Dis lodge
has raised jes’ half of dat money. Therefo’ I moves
you dat dis lodge bestow de Revun Vinegar Atts wid
jes’ one D!”</p>

<p>“Shore!” Figger Bush squeaked. “He oughter
be satisfied wid one D.”</p>

<p>“How would dat suit you, Revun?” Hitch Diamond
asked.</p>

<p>“Dat’ll suit fine,” Vinegar smiled, his eager eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
resting upon the parchment in Green’s hand. “Ef I
kin buy de doctor part of de double D, I’s willin’
to let de Dervinity part of it slide.”</p>

<p>“Ever who favors bestowin’ de Revun Vinegar
Atts wid one D say aye!” Hitch Diamond howled.</p>

<p>“Aye!” the crowd bellowed.</p>

<p>“I thanks you-all fer yo’ int’rust,” Green Trapps
announced quietly. “We will bestow de Revun
Vinegar Atts wid one D at de Shoofly chu’ch tomorrer
night.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All day long Vinegar Atts occupied himself by
decorating the Shoofly church. He had festooned
the building with arm-loads of long Spanish moss
taken from the trees in the swamp. He had brought
a wagon-load of ferns and palms and wild flowers
from the fields and woods, and now as the shadows
of the evening lengthened in the large, barnlike
structure, he viewed the result with dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“I needs dat settee an’ readin’ lamp to sot off dese
here decorooshuns,” he sighed, scratching his head
in perplexity. “Atter I git my D, I got to go an’ set
down in a ole chair wid de bottom busted out, an’ dat
ain’t doin’ it up in de right sort of style.”</p>

<p>He walked up and surveyed the offending chair,
turned it over and looked underneath and uttered a
disgusted grunt. He could make nothing out of it
except what it was, a broken, dilapidated chair.
Then a great idea entered his head.</p>

<p>“I bet de white folks is got plenty pulpit chairs an’
readin’ lamps dat dey don’t need. I’ll go out an’ beg
a few.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later Vinegar paused at the gate
before the home of the Rev. Dr. Sentelle.</p>

<p>There were only two churches in Tickfall, one for
the whites and one for the blacks. For nearly thirty
years neither church had had a change of preachers,
so that Dr. Sentelle and Vinegar Atts were old
friends and workers in the Tickfall vineyard.</p>

<p>Dr. Sentelle was a scholar, an orator, and a cripple.
All that can be comprised in the statement that the
people, white and black, loved him almost to adoration,
will express what he was to Tickfall.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts was a squatty, pot-bellied black giant
with long gorilla-like arms; he was bald except for a
little tuft of hair over each ear, which made him
look like a moon-faced mule wearing a blind bridle.
He was not a scholar, nor a cripple. He could hang
some steel hooks in a five-hundred-pound bale of
cotton and trot up the gangplank of a steamboat
singing a religious song and not start the perspiration
on the top of his bald head by the achievement.</p>

<p>As for oratory, his colored friends thought that
Vinegar was the prince of platform spellbinders.
He had the pertinacious guinea-fowl’s gift of gab, a
voice which could be heard for two miles, and a <i>vox
humana</i> stop to his chest tones that threw in the
tremolo for funeral and evangelistic occasions and
made his emotional auditors weep copiously over
something they did not know anything about.</p>

<p>Vinegar paused at the gate because a stranger was
sitting on the porch beside Dr. Sentelle. Vinegar
“read sign” on this strange white man to determine
whether it would be worth while to go up and interrupt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
his conversation by requesting a favor. The
stranger was old, white-haired, and his movements
and the sound of his voice indicated that he was
feeble. Vinegar did not know it, but he was looking
at the Rev. Dr. Gilbo, president of the Silliway Female
Institute.</p>

<p>“Dat white man is some sort broke-down preacher,”
Vinegar soliloquized, and he rattled the gate-latch
loudly.</p>

<p>“All right, Vinegar, come in!” Dr. Sentelle called.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, white folks,” Vinegar murmured,
bowing apologetically to the stranger. “I come
to ax Elder Sentelle could he he’p me outen a
jam.”</p>

<p>“Has the Shoofly outfit fired you?” Dr. Sentelle
smiled.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh. Dey’s gwine bestow special honors
on me to-night,” Vinegar chuckled, smoothing his
stovepipe hat with a big handkerchief. “I done
spent de day fixin’ up de chu’ch wid flowers, an’ now
I needs two mo’ things to gimme style. Is you white
folks got a pulpit chair an’ a ’lectric readin’ lamp dat
you ain’t needin’?”</p>

<p>Dr. Sentelle appeared to give himself up to deep
thought. In reality he was devoting himself to an
internal enjoyment of that amusing request. Dr.
Gilbo uttered a surprised chuckle which he promptly
covered by a cough and hastily offered Vinegar a
cigar.</p>

<p>“What sort of honor is going to be bestowed on
you, Vinegar?” Dr. Sentelle asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p>

<p>“De Nights of Darkness Lodge is bought me a D,”
Vinegar told him.</p>

<p>The white men remained silent, praying for more
light. Vinegar busied himself with his cigar, placing
the gold band on his little finger and lighting the
smoke.</p>

<p>“That’s quite an honor,” Dr. Sentelle ventured,
wondering what he was talking about and hoping
that Vinegar would say something to illumine the
darkness.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh. Dey comes pretty tol’able expensive
an’ de lodge couldn’t affode to buy but one,” Vinegar
replied, and a little note of disappointment was in
his voice.</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” Dr. Sentelle murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>“De cost wus twenty-five dollars per each D,”
Vinegar sighed. “Of co’se dat’s most too high fer
niggers to pay, even jes’ one. So I’s mighty glad to
git it.”</p>

<p>“Are you alluding to some lodge degree, my man?”
Dr. Gilbo asked.</p>

<p>“Naw, suh, it’s a preacher degree. All de fust-class
preachers has ’em. Of co’se, I would druther
hab a D.D., but two of ’em costes fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>With a gasp of astonishment the two men comprehended
what Vinegar was talking about.</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand,” Dr. Gilbo murmured. “You
are receiving the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, dat’s it. Only but I don’t git but one
D.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>“May I inquire what college is honoring you?”
Gilbo asked.</p>

<p>Vinegar’s answer came very near being the end of
Dr. Gilbo.</p>

<p>“De Silliway Female Institoot,” Vinegar told him.</p>

<p>Then there was silence for the space of ten minutes.
Vinegar stood as quietly as a mule hitched to a post.
Dr. Sentelle’s frail body was shaking with suppressed
laughter. Dr. Gilbo felt that his reason was tottering
on the crystal throne of intellect. At last Vinegar
spoke:</p>

<p>“Could you lend me de loant of de pulpit chair an’
de readin’ lamp, elder?”</p>

<p>“No,” Dr. Sentelle murmured chokingly, “I
deeply regret that I cannot.”</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh,” Vinegar responded. “I knows
you would ef you could. I reckin I better mosey on.
I’s shore much obleeged to dis here nice white man
fer my seegar. Thank e, Kunnel.”</p>

<p>Vinegar turned and walked as far as the gate,
when Sentelle called to him.</p>

<p>“Vinegar, my friend and I would like to attend the
meeting at the Shoofly church to-night.”</p>

<p>Vinegar’s stovepipe hat swept the ground and his
grotesque body was distorted into an elaborate bow.</p>

<p>“My Lawd, white folks,” he howled in delight.
“Dis pore ole nigger won’t ax de good Lawd fer no
better blessin’ dan to hab you-alls come out to de
Shoofly. I’ll hab a place on de flatforms fer bofe
you-alls. De orgies begins at nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“That rascal, Green Trapps, is at the bottom of
this,” Dr. Gilbo said with conviction. “I am going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
out to the Shoofly church to-night, but I don’t intend
to arrive at the beginning of the exercises. I
think I shall appear at the psychological moment.”</p>

<p>“I’s wid you in dat plan, white folks,” Dr. Sentelle
snickered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was never any trouble to get a crowd in the
Shoofly church. All that was necessary was to ring
the bell and the colored population flocked to the
church like doves to the windows.</p>

<p>But on this occasion all the brothers of the lodge
had hinted that there would be a most important
meeting on this particular night, the grapevine telephone
had carried the news, and the people began to
arrive from the swamps and plantations long before
dark. Some of the old women anxious to get a good
seat, went trailing up to the church just about sunset
like a lot of old hens going to roost.</p>

<p>By nine o’clock there was not standing room in
the church, nor a fence-post or a tree around the
building to which another horse or mule could be
hitched.</p>

<p>After the congregation had sung songs until they
were almost exhausted, Hitch Diamond stepped up
to the platform and spoke:</p>

<p>“Brudders an’ sisteren, we is come to dis place so
dat de lodge brudders of de Nights of Darkness kin
bestow a D on Revun Vinegar Atts. Eve’ybody
chipped in a few change an’ we bought it fer him wid
twenty-five dollars. De high chief money-keeper
will now advance an’ hand over de money.”</p>

<p>Figger Bush pushed through the crowd, and emptied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
all his pockets, as he laid a pile of silver on a
little table beside the pulpit.</p>

<p>“I ain’t spent none of it, brudders,” he announced.
“It’s all right dar jes’ like you gib it to me.”</p>

<p>“Perfessor Green Trapps will now advance wid de
obscribe!” Hitch commanded.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Green rose from a chair near the pulpit
and walked to the little table. He took from his
pocket a square of sheepskin, spread it out before
him, and flattened it out by piling a handful of silver
around the edges. Then he fitted his gold spectacles
to his pop eyes, unscrewed the top of a fountain pen
and sat down.</p>

<p>There was a slight commotion at the door, but
Green did not notice it. There was a scrouging of
people who stood in the aisle in order that two distinguished
white men might pass, but Green Trapps
did not notice that. Green looked up just as the two
white men stood at the pulpit railing almost within
reach of his hand. Then his startled eyes gazed down
into the faces of Dr. Gilbo, president of the Silliway
Female Institute, and Dr. Sentelle.</p>

<p>“Gawdlemighty!” Green gasped. He sprang from
his chair and sent that piece of furniture whirling
across the platform. With four gigantic leaps he
covered the space between himself and the nearest
window, and he went through that window, splashing
the crowd out of his way in his exit like a brickbat
dropped in a puddle of black mud.</p>

<p>The people were dazed by this sudden departure
of Trapps, and they waited breathlessly for what
might happen next. Dr. Gilbo strode upon the pulpit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
platform and stopped at the table where Green
had been sitting. With a snort of indignation, he
realized that his servant, Green Trapps, had stolen
one of his college graduate diplomas, and was just
about to fill it out with the name of Vinegar Atts.</p>

<p>Dr. Gilbo turned and addressed the audience:</p>

<p>“My colored friends, I regret to inform you that
Green Trapps is a fraud and impostor, also a liar and
a thief. He persuaded you to raise a sum of money
to purchase from him an honorary degree from the
Silliway Female Institute which he had no right or
power to bestow. This college, of which I am president,
does not grant honorary degrees, and if it did,
we would not sell such an honor under any circumstances
or at any price. I think you should congratulate
yourselves upon my arrival just in time to thwart
the nefarious designs of Green Trapps. He was
endeavoring to secure money under false pretenses,
and if I remain in my present state of righteous
indignation, I shall have him prosecuted under the
law.”</p>

<p>Then Dr. Gilbo stalked off the platform and sat
down.</p>

<p>“Beg parding, boss,” Hitch Diamond mumbled.
“Does I gather from dem remarks of yourn dat
Brudder Vinegar Atts don’t git no D?”</p>

<p>“He does not from the Silliway Female Institute,”
Dr. Gilbo answered.</p>

<p>“Dat’s too bad,” Hitch Diamond rumbled, scratching
his head and wondering what to do next.</p>

<p>At this point, Skeeter Butts, who was sitting in the
choir, rose and said:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<p>“Brudder Hitchie, I moves dat de twenty-five
dollars dat Green Trapps didn’t git be give to Elder
Vinegar Atts to buy a pulpit chair an’ a ’lectric readin’
lamp.”</p>

<p>“I seconts dat motion,” Pap Curtain snarled.
“Dat’ll let Vinegar down kinder easy an’ won’t hurt
his feelin’s so much.”</p>

<p>When Hitch Diamond put the question, the motion
was carried with a whoop and everybody was in a
good humor again.</p>

<p>“Less sing our lodge song fer de closin’ exercises,
brudders,” Hitch bellowed. “Eve’ybody sing!”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ef a smile we kin renew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our journey we pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, de good we all may do<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While de days is gwine by.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this mighty chorus, Dr. Sentelle missed a voice
that he loved&mdash;the superb baritone of Vinegar Atts.
That voice, like the tones of a great pipe-organ, was
the joy and pride of Tickfall. Now it was silent.</p>

<p>Dr. Sentelle turned and looked at Vinegar. The
pastor of the Shoofly church sat huddled in a heap
in his broken-bottomed pulpit chair, looking like a
big, fat dumpling soaked in gravy. His simple,
childish, baby face was puckered and drawn with sad
lines until he looked like a big fat baby just tuning
up to cry.</p>

<p>In fact, Vinegar was completely crushed. He had
set his heart upon that meaningless piece of parchment
and that sham degree, and the loss to him was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
overwhelming. The pathos of ignorance lies here,
that the untaught covet above everything the tinsel
and feathers and adornments of knowledge.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, de worl’ is full of sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of sad an’ weepin’ eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’p yo’ fallen brudder rise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While de days is gwine by.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Still Vinegar’s superb voice was silent, and Dr.
Sentelle felt a sense of loss and dissatisfaction. The
music was not complete.</p>

<p>Then something happened which explains why all
Tickfall, white and black, loved Dr. Sentelle almost
to adoration.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea burst like an opening blossom
in the scholar’s brain, and brought forth its fruit of
kindly and gracious service. He rose to his feet, leaning
his frail body heavily upon his ponderous cane for
support, and held up a thin, blue-veined, delicate
hand for silence. The singing stopped.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he began in a voice so thrillingly
sweet and musical that every word was like a caress,
“for over thirty years your pastor, Vinegar Atts, and
I have been the only preachers in Tickfall. He and
I have spent many an hour in that time discussing
together the problems which concern both the white
and the black people of Tickfall. While the days
have been going by, Vinegar has added much to my
joy of living, and I am sure that he has never robbed
you of any happiness.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s right!” a dozen voices murmured.</p>

<p>“I have always tried to stand between you colored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
people and any kind of harm, and it pleases me tonight
that I have been instrumental in preventing
you from paying something for nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing!”</p>

<p>“Thank ’e, suh!” several voices spoke.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I believe that Vinegar Atts very
richly deserves the one D which you in your kindness
were trying to purchase for him.”</p>

<p>“Hear dat, now!”</p>

<p>“The word ‘doctor’ is an academic title, originally
meaning a man so well versed in his department as
to be qualified to teach it. I knew Vinegar Atts
years ago as a prize-fighter, and I have seen him fight;
and I assure you that in the department of pugilistic
activity, Vinegar is well enough versed in the manly
art of self-defense to know how to teach it!”</p>

<p>“Now you done said a plum’ mouthful!” Hitch
Diamond, the Tickfall Tiger, howled. “Elder Atts
teached me all <i>I</i> know ’bout fightin’!”</p>

<p>“Thirty years have passed since Vinegar became
the pastor of the Shoofly church. In that time,
negro preachers have come and gone through the
other negro churches in this parish like a Mardi Gras
procession, but Vinegar holds on to his job. It is
my conviction that a man so endowed with the gift
of continuance possesses the supreme art of pleasing
all the people all the time, and should be qualified
to teach that art to others.”</p>

<p>“Listen to dat white man!” a chorus of voices
mumbled in admiration.</p>

<p>“I therefore believe that Vinegar Atts richly
deserves the title of doctor, and I therefore greet him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
as a fellow clergyman with his honorary entitlements:
‘Dr. Vinegar Atts.’”</p>

<p>Vinegar was not slumped down in his chair now.
He was sitting up in his broken-bottomed chair,
his backbone as stiff as if he had swallowed a ramrod.
Dr. Sentelle walked over and held out his hand.
Vinegar sprang up with a half sob and seized that
fragile white hand in his gorilla-like black paw.</p>

<p>There was a shout from that congregation which
nearly lifted the roof off the church.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Gilbo was suddenly galvanized into
action. He sprang up from his seat and knocked
his hat on the floor. He jerked his hands in and out
of his pockets, seeking for something, and in his
eagerness he spilled something out of each pocket.</p>

<p>Suddenly he found what he wanted and held it up&mdash;a
little square box, such as jewelers use. Taking
the top from the box, he brought out a small gold
medal about the size of a postage stamp, and almost
as thin.</p>

<p>“My colored friends,” Dr. Gilbo announced in a
shrill, high voice. “This gold medal which you
behold is bestowed upon the deserving pupils of the
Silliway Female Institute as a reward of merit. At our
graduating exercises last June twenty-five of these
medals were given away, but it happened that no
pupil earned the one which I hold in my hand. It is
now my pleasure to confer this medal on Dr. Vinegar
Atts!”</p>

<p>When Dr. Gilbo walked across the platform and
pinned his medal upon the lapel of Vinegar’s long-tailed
preaching-coat, there is no language to describe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
the whoop of adulation which sprang from the throats
of that delighted audience.</p>

<p>Vinegar Atts sat down and wiped the tears from
his eyes upon his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>“Us would like to hear a speech from de Revun
Dr. Vinegar Atts!” Hitch Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p>The prince of platform spellbinders stood up and
made a speech of two words, but in the intonation of
those two words he comprised all that a negro can
express of eloquent gratitude:</p>

<p>“Bless Gawd!”</p>

<p>He sat down for the last time in his broken pulpit
chair, and his powerful shoulders quivered with
emotion. The next day he put a new chair in its
place, adorned his pulpit with an electric reading
lamp, and recovered his gift of gab.</p>

<p>“Lodge brudders, attention!” Hitch Diamond
bellowed. “Give de good-night salute an’ sing de
last verse!”</p>

<p>The men folded their hands over their breasts
and their superb voices chanted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But de deeds of good we sow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bofe in shade an’ shine will grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ will keep our hearts aglow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While de days is gwine by.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. Sentelle listened and smiled. The music was
complete.</p>

<p>He reflected that he had never heard Dr. Vinegar
Atts sing so well.

<p>A tale of the West, a story of the Wild; of
three strange comrades,--Whistling Dan of
the untamed soul, within whose mild eyes
there lurks the baleful yellow glare of beast
anger; of the mighty black stallion Satan, King
of the Ranges, and the wolf devil dog, to
whom their master’s word is the only law,--and
of the Girl.</p>

<p>How Jim Silent, the "long-rider" and outlaw,
declared feud with Dan, how of his right-hand
men one strove for the Girl, one for
the horse, and one to “‘get’ that black devil
of a dog," and their desperate efforts to
achieve their ends, form but part of the stirring
action.</p>

<p>A tale of the West, yes--but a most unusual
one, touched with an almost weird
poetic fancy from the very first page, when
over the sandy wastes sounds the clear sweet
whistling of Pan of the desert, to the very
last paragraph when the reader, too, hears the
cry and the call of the wild geese flying
south.</p>

<p>But for the sin, they would have lived happily
from their meeting&mdash;and there would have been
no story. But the sin brought misunderstanding,
making the old road of true love rough&mdash;for
awhile. But it strengthened the courage and the

And the Man and the Girl found their hard-won

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
